	- Queue::push('SendEmail@send', array('message' => $message));
	- $date = Carbon::now()->addMinutes(15);

		- In this example, we're using the Carbon date library to specify the delay we wish to assign to the job. 
		- Alternatively, you may pass the number of seconds you wish to delay as an integer.
		- Deleting A Processed Job
			public function fire($job, $data = null)
			{
    			// Process the job...
    			$job->delete();
			}

		- If you wish to release a job back onto the queue, you may do so via the release method:
			public function fire($job, $data = null)
			{
    			// Process the job...
    			$job->release();
			}
		- php artisan queue:listen
