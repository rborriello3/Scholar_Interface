I am pleased to recommend Travis Dass for the Graduating Student Scholarship. I have had the opportunity to know Travis for the past two-years. He enrolled in three of my Mathematics courses: Intermediate Algebra-Fall 2011, College Algebra-Spring 2012 and Calculus I Summer 2012. In all my classes he excelled academically. He has outstanding analytical, conceptual and communication skills. He is a conscientious and dedicated student and takes his education in a mature and serious manner. Based on my observations, he has great interpersonal skills and interacts with fellow students and faculty members in a respectful and professional way. Travis has a clear goal in mind for his future.  He wants to become a Petroleum Engineer.  After graduation form SUNY Orange in May, he will transfer to Louisiana State University to pursue a baccalaureate degree in Petroleum Engineering. He is a member of professional organizations such as the New York Society of Professional Engineers and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. 

Travis has taken academic challenges at SUNY Orange with great enthusiasm and optimism since he enrolled in August of 2011. His cumulative grade point average clearly demonstrates his dedication and hard work. 

It is with no reservation that I recommend this well deserving student to the SUNY Orange Scholarship Committee. Travis’s dedication and determination to get a quality education leaves a lasting positive impression on those of us who have had a chance to know him. I am confident that he will successfully achieve his academic goals at Louisiana State University.

Mr. Ponzoni has shown himself to be a student of top academic standard, integrity and promise.  His personal demeanor is cheerful and intellectually he is both inquisitive and astute.  Presently, I have Mr. Ponzoni as a student in my Personal Finance class; this is the third class in which he has been a student of mine.  In each of the previous classes, Accounting Principles 1 (fall 2012) and Accounting Applications on the Microcomputer (fall 2013); Mr. Ponzoni was among my top students.  In all three classes George has always been well prepared often contributing with both solutions and penetrating questions on the topics being presented. Some of the questions he posed in Accounting Principles lead to engaging class discussions on accounting theory verses accounting practice, and usually helped the class as a whole gain a clearer understanding of the discussed topic.  In the Accounting Applications class which confronts students in an array of accounting issues George developed Excel spreadsheets that through smart and effective designs solve challenging problems.  As an instructor I greatly enjoy having a student of Mr. Ponzoni’s caliber in class, and additionally appreciate his dedication, wit and friendly personality.  

Outside of the classroom, George offers much to his peers and the college community at large.  He currently is serving in the college’s student senate as the treasurer for the current academic year.  This follows his previous position working in the governing process as a student senator.  Mr. Ponzoni also helps the college at large serving as a voting member on both the Campus Safety and Security Committee and the Executive Committee.  Additionally, George is engaged in his second year working as a volunteer tax preparer here on campus, helping his peers and the community in general.  To serve in this capacity requires taking time to learn the latest tax laws and pass an online IRS certification exam.  

Mr. George Ponzoni is a highly talented student with much scholastic promise.  It is my hope that you will consider Mr. Ponzoni for the graduating student scholarship.

During this second attempt at the course, Samantha brought a much different approach and level of commitment to the course; her conscientiousness, commitment to learning, and willingness to accept a challenge and ask for help were much of the reason why her second attempt at the course proved to be successful.  Although Samantha did not earn one of the top grades in the course, she certainly was one of the hardest working students in the course.  She demonstrated regular preparation for class, asked questions (both inside and outside of class) when she did not understand something and she always strived to completely understand the material or topic being discussed.  Her commitment to learning far exceeded that of many other students and her academics were without question a top priority in her life.  She has a love for learning that is evident in what she brings to the table as a student.

Upon graduating from SUNY Orange with an Associate’s Degree in Science: Biology, Samantha plans to transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a Bachelor’s Degree in Biology.   An example of the initiative she takes is that she is currently not sure exactly what field within biology she would like to pursue.  To try and help determine this for herself, she has utilized the personality/career assessment tests offered by our Career and Internship Services to help narrow down her search along with setting her up with job shadowing opportunities.  I am extremely confident that she has the potential to reach her academic goal, as well as her career goal of becoming a biologist in whatever biology field she selects.  

In addition to being a scholar at SUNY Orange, Samantha works part-time as a waitress/bartender at a local restaurant, as well as volunteers at a local animal shelter. Additionally her household is part of the National Dachshund Rescue where she houses abused and abandoned dachshunds and helps them with getting along with other animals and people. So in addition to her achievements as a student, she is one that gives back to the community as well.   

Samantha is very conscientious, dedicated, disciplined, enthusiastic about learning and is not one to back down from a challenge.

Allastar Smith has asked me for a letter of recommendation.   He is a strong student and someone worthy of consideration.

In fall 2013, Allastar joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program, coming to the College after having taken approximately thirty college credits while in high school.  Joining the Honors Program, like deciding to take as many college credits in high school as possible, exemplifies his commitment to academics and his drive.  Though he has only been in the program for just under a year, I met him several years ago as his older brother also completed the Honors Program.  He is developing into an interesting young man with a nice sense of humor and a desire to learn.  At the College, he will earn an Associate in Science degree and currently, his GPA is a 3.66.
 
As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as Allastar’s academic advisor and instructor for Honors Humanities II and Honors Capstone I.  This spring, he is completing Honors Capstone II and Honors Seminar: Gender Roles.  In class, he is prepared with assignments, whether reading, written or oral.  He is learning to make connections across disciplines and is improving his critical thinking and reading.  This fall, Allastar took Honors: Introduction to Humanities II, a new team-taught offering.  He approached each assignment differently, trying to utilize skills we presented in class.  Overall, he is academically curious with a wide-range of interests and a willingness to try new concepts and ideas.  He is growing confident taking appropriate risks.  

The Honors Program requires a minimum of eighteen honors credits; Allastar will graduate with nineteen, having completed his A.S. with the Honors designation, in two semesters, the latter a significant achievement.  In addition to the honors general education and seminar classes, we require 45 hours of community service, something which is an important concept for and practice of his entire family.  He is meeting that service requirement while also completing his capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  His project explores current theories of time travel, evaluating them for feasibility with our current level of technology.  The capstone project requires time management, planning, organization, dedication, and focus, plus strong research, writing and presenting skills.  He has handled the stages thus far.  In April, he will present the paper publically in a mini-defense.  The project also will be submitted to the Beacon Conference, a research competition for two-year college students.  

Allastar is a nice young man with a great deal of potential.  I highly recommend him for a transfer scholarship.

Sean Harrington has asked me for a letter of recommendation, which I am happy to provide.  He is a very strong student and someone very worthy of consideration.

Sean joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program in fall 2012, as an incoming freshman.  The decision to join the program exemplifies his commitment to academics and desire to excel.  Sean also interviewed for and received a President’s Honors Program Scholarship, impressing the interview committee with his maturity, focus and overall comportment.  He has done very well, quickly fitting in and making his mark.   
 
As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as Sean’s academic advisor and instructor for Honors Service Learning, Honors Capstone I and Honors: Introduction to Humanities II.  This spring, he is finishing Honors Capstone II.  In class, he is always prepared with assignments, whether reading, video, written or oral, having carefully considered the material.  He makes connections across disciplines and thinks and reads critically.  His writing continues to improve as does his ability to do public presentations—a strength of his.   

At (SUNY) Orange County Community College, he will earn an Associate in Science degree with an Engineering Science concentration, and an Honors Program designation.  Both require a serious commitment to academics (Engineering is one of our most difficult degrees) and the latter also promotes cultural, service and social endeavors; he is performing well in all areas.  His enthusiasm, work ethic (he often studies with his peers) and friendly personality have led him to become a natural leader in the Honors Program.  He helps other students and serves as a positive role model.  His instructors, both honors and non, speak highly of his dedication to and enthusiasm for learning.  The Honors Program Advisory Board members all are proud of Sean, as a person as well as his academic and non-academic accomplishments. 

The Honors Program requires a minimum of eighteen honors credits; Sean will graduate with nineteen.  In addition to the honors general education and seminar classes, we also require 45 hours of community service, which he easily completed; he helps with recruiting and Admissions activities, does fundraising and helped lead the campus-wide Completion Day initiative.  Another significant honors requirement is our capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  He is exploring the pros and cons of sugar substitutes. This project requires time management, planning, organization, dedication, and focus, plus strong research, writing and presenting skills.  He also will submit the paper to the Beacon Conference, a research competition for two-year college students.   

This semester, Sean stepped out of the science and engineering focus to take Honors Introduction to Humanities II.  In examining the arts, architecture, music, history and literature, in addition to the sciences, philosophy and religion (from the Renaissance to the present), he explored several museums and cultural sites, presented as part of various groups on different cultural and social developments and periods, and did individual presentations on his experiences.  He has sketched, taken photographs and employed other representational forms (including collage) to express what he learned and his reactions to it.  His unique approaches always got to the heart of the experiences in a very organized and clear manner.  He made cross disciplinary connections and employed high level critical thinking.  While his science background influenced his experiences, he developed skills and knowledge outside of it, which was an interesting progression to witness.   

Sean is very involved with the College and Honors Program communities.  He serves as a student representative on the Honors Advisory Board, helping with program planning, assessment, recruiting, marketing, and serving as a liaison to the students.  He assisted this summer with the scholarship interviews, providing a unique perspective, and a calm, thoughtful and mature manner which helped students better understand their role as scholarship recipients.  He also serves as an Honors Program peer mentor.  As such, he assisted at Honors Orientation and also has five freshmen Honors students for whom he is responsible: maintaining regular contact with them and serving as a resource to help them through the all-important first year adjustment to college and honors.  He is an active member of the Engineering Club and all of its activities.

Outside of school, he works a great deal and continues service activities.  With all of these activities both on and off campus, his current GPA is a 3.77, a testament to his academic abilities, determination, and focus.  At the end of his final semester, his GPA may well be higher.  

I highly recommend Sean for a transfer scholarship; he will represent himself, the Honors Program and the College in a very positive manner.

Vivek Sood has asked me for a letter of recommendation.  He is a very strong student who is worthy of consideration.

Vivek joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program in fall 2012 with twenty-eight college credits already completed in high school.  The decision to join the program as well as his previous college credits are testaments to his commitment to academics and desire to excel.  He immediately impressed the Honors Advisory Board’s Scholarship sub-committee with his strong public speaking ability and his comfort in interviews.  He was awarded a Presidential Honors Program Scholarship, which has covered his tuition and fees for two years.  

As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as Vivek’s academic advisor and instructor for Honors Service Learning, and Honors Capstone I and II (the latter which he is completing this spring).  Though I have not had Vivek in a three-credit class, from reports from other professors and in my limited experience, he is always prepared with assignments, whether reading, written or oral, having carefully considered the material.  He makes connections across disciplines and thinks very critically.  He is a confident public speaker, participates well in class and brings an appropriate sense of humor to many situations.  He is academically curious about a wide range of topics, asks thoughtful questions and is not afraid to ask for help or try a new idea.  He takes constructive criticism well and takes appropriate risks.  He is also a thoughtful and supportive classmate; in the capstone class, which is often stressful, he listens carefully to other students’ topics, asks good questions of them and provides positive feedback and suggestions.  Just this week in class, he devised different and creative ways of applauding each individual who presented paper outlines.  While this may seem trivial, his peers appreciated the support and laughed, which helped lessen their tension and nervousness.   In an honors political science course, his presentation, which was absolutely accurate in content, was done in an imitation of the The Daily Show with John Stewart.

At (SUNY) Orange, in May, Vivek will graduate with an Associate’s Degree (with a Business Administration concentration) and the Honors Program designation.  The latter requires a serious commitment to academic, cultural, service and social endeavors; he performs well in all areas.  His instructors, both honors and non, speak highly of his academic abilities and work ethic.

The Honors Program requires a minimum of eighteen honors credits; Vivek will graduate with 19.  In addition to the honors general education and seminar classes, we also require 45 hours of community service, which he easily completed, serving as a Youth in Government advisor (at his old high school), representing SUNY Orange and the Honors Program at college fairs at his high school, assistant coaching for his high school tennis team, organizing temple activities and helping with Honors Program fundraisers.  This year, Vivek serves as an Honors Program peer mentor. As such, he has five freshmen honors students for whom he is responsible: maintaining regular contact with them and serving as a resource to help them through the all-important first year adjustment to college and honors.  He helped with our Honors Program Student Orientation this fall.  He was also our nominee for the SUNY Chancellor’s Award for Student Excellence, an honor he recently received.

Another significant program requirement is our honors capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  He is exploring whether or not the US’s foreign policies have contributed to acts of terrorism committed against it.  This project requires time management, planning, organization, dedication, and focus, plus strong research, writing and presenting skills.  He has done very well thus far in the process, staying ahead in the work and keeping a positive attitude.  He will present the paper in a mini-defense in April as well as submit it to the Beacon Conference, a research competition for two-year college students.  In an effort to gain additional experience with academic research and presentation, Vivek submitted an abstract proposal to the Northeast Regional Honors Council Conference.  In early April, he will present his paper on the dangers of racial profiling.

Outside of school, he works an average of thirty hours a week at a local credit union. With all of these activities both on and off campus, his current cumulative GPA is a 3.96, a true reflection of his academic abilities, determination, and focus.  His goal is to be an investment banker.  He is developing the skills and knowledge to make that dream a reality.

I highly recommend Vivek for a transfer scholarship as he will represent himself, the Honors Program and the College very well as he moves on.

Margaret (Maggie) Damken has asked me for a letter of recommendation, which I am happy to provide.   She is a very strong student and overall, a nice young woman, someone very worthy of consideration.

Maggie joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program in the fall of 2012, coming to us with twelve college credits taken in high school.  Both decisions exemplify her commitment to push herself academically and learn as much as she possibly can.  She has been a very active student in the program. At SUNY Orange, she is pursuing an Associates in Arts degree (with a concentration in English), with an Honors Program designation.   
 
As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as her academic advisor as well as her instructor for Honors Contemporary Novel (accelerated), Honors Service Learning, Honors Introduction to Humanities II and Honors Capstone I.   She will continue with Honors Capstone II with me this spring.  In class, Maggie is always prepared and ready to learn.  Her assignments, whether reading, written or oral, are complete and she has thought carefully about the material.  She makes connections across disciplines, asks thoughtful questions, and thinks and reads critically.  Her writing, while very strong when she came, continues to improve as does her confidence speaking in group or presentation situations.  She possesses a great deal of academic curiosity and is ready to try new things.  Perhaps this was best seen this fall in Honors: Introduction to Humanities II, a new team-taught offering.  While initially reluctant to take the course, she became one of the most consistent high-level presenters.  Every assignment demonstrated her strong research and writing skills, but she also incorporated a unique, artistic approach to material and experiences (which included visits to museums and cultural sites).  She utilized her strengths to broaden the background of her newly acquired knowledge and skills, using photography, drawing, and collage to provide a visual rather than just written perspective.  She slowly is growing more confident taking appropriate risks.  

The honors designation requires a serious commitment to academic, cultural and social endeavors.  She has performed well in all.  Her teachers speak well of her and her classmates enjoy her sense of humor and focus on academics.  She a genuinely nice person who is truly interested in her peers and often has a smile on her face—even during stressful times of the semester.  Her personality and commitment to academics make her a valuable leader in the Honors Program.

The Honors Program requires a minimum of 18 honors credits; Maggie should graduate with 22.  One of the requirements is 45 hours of community service, which she had no difficulties completing; she tutored students with homework (Middletown Thrall Library Homework Help Program), took class notes for a student with disabilities, worked at a health fair for elementary students, helped with the Thrall used bookstore, manned a Voter Registration Drive, and clerked at a Red Cross blood drive.   On campus, she is a member of our College’s Phi Theta Kappa chapter and a founding member for the English Club, created by students in the Honors Program.  Additionally, she helps with all program fundraisers (earning the third most money in one of our efforts) and serves as a peer mentor for the program.  For the latter, she has five freshmen honors students for whom she is responsible: maintaining regular contact with them and serving as a resource to guide them through the all-important first semester adjustment to college and honors.  

Another honors requirement is our capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  She is exploring the possibility that the US is becoming a dystopian society.  This project requires time management, organization, dedication, and focus, in addition to research, writing and presenting skills.  She has done extremely well in all areas thus far and is well into the project.  The paper will be presented and defended in April and also submitted to the Beacon Conference, a research paper competition for two-year college students.  In an effort to gain more experience with academic research and increase her comfort-level with public presentation, as a freshman, Maggie submitted an abstract proposal to the Northeast Regional Honors Conference that was accepted.  Last April, she gave a poster presentation on the economic, environmental and legal impacts of hydraulic fracturing.  The poster format allowed her to gain confidence in public speaking.  After the conference, she and two others gave a presentation to the College’s Foundation Board (which partially funded the conference) on their experiences and the importance of attending student conferences.  This experience positively impacted her growth in this area.  She is now a much more confident speaker.

Outside of school, Maggie spends a great deal of time with her family, with whom she is very close. With all of her activities and family responsibilities, she maintains a 3.81 cumulative GPA, which speaks to her determination, time management skills and academic abilities.

I highly recommend Maggie for a transfer scholarship.

I am pleased to be able to recommend Mr. William Perez.  I have known Mr. Perez for about a year.  He has taken History of the Middle East from me.   His performance in this class was exemplary.  He demonstrated a clear grasp of course material and a keen sense of the relevance of historical events to world events today.  His insightful observations contributed significantly to the learner-centered foundations of this class.

Mr. Perez is an excellent undergraduate writer.  His essays are thoughtful and logical, marshaling facts and evidence into coherent arguments on controversial historical questions.  He is seldom satisfied to do only what is required; rather, he seeks additional challenges to broaden his knowledge and reasoning ability.  He was initially rather quiet in class, but soon began asking interesting questions and offering incisive comments on topics under discussion.

I am certain that, regardless of the field or discipline Mr. Perez chooses to pursue, he will bring to it intelligence, dedication, and a determination to be among the best of students.  I can, therefore, recommend him heartily.

Respectfully,

William Perez has asked me for a letter of recommendation, which I am happy to provide.   He is a very strong student and someone very worthy of consideration.

In fall 2012, Will joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program, coming to the College after having taken almost two semesters’ worth of college credits in high school.  Joining the Honors Program, like deciding to take as many college credits in high school as possible, exemplify his commitment to academics, his drive and his desire to excel.  He works very hard and has become an unexpected leader in the program.  He earned our James Ottaway Jr. Honors Program scholarship, which covers some of his tuition for his two-year degree and later an International Studies scholarship.
 
As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as Will’s academic advisor and instructor for Honors Service Learning, Honors Non-European Literature, Honors Humanities II and Honors Capstone I.  This spring, he is completing Honors Capstone II.  In class, Will is always prepared with assignments, whether reading, video, written or oral, and has carefully considered the material.  He makes connections across disciplines and thinks and reads critically.  His writing continues to improve; he often comes in for help or to discuss ways to better his material.  One of his strengths is public speaking: he is a very strong presenter and creates excellent visual aids.  This fall, Will took Honors: Introduction to Humanities II, a new team-taught offering.  Every assignment he submitted showed marked improvement as he went to museums and cultural sites, analyzed various pieces and incorporated his strengths to broaden the background of his assignments.  He created collages, improved his own photography and approached every assignment from a visual rather than written perspective.  His development has been impressive.  Overall, Will is academically curious, always wanting to learn.  He asks thoughtful questions and is not afraid to ask for help or try a new idea.  He is growing confident taking appropriate risks.  

At (SUNY) Orange County Community College, he will earn an Associate in Arts degree in International Studies.  The latter requires a serious commitment to academic, cultural, service and social endeavors; he is performing well in all areas.  His current GPA is a 3.69 but may well be higher after his last term.  His grades have improved every semester and should continue to do so.  During his second year, he decided to further challenge himself by taking classes that may well earn an Associates in Science in addition to the A.A. degree.  He is very motivated to challenge himself and expand his potential.

The Honors Program requires a minimum of eighteen honors credits; William will graduate with 22.  In addition to the honors general education and seminar classes, we require 45 hours of community service, which he easily completed.  He volunteered both at the YMCA and back at his high school.  He felt the latter was a way to pay back those who had helped him grow and develop.  Another significant honors requirement is our capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  He is exploring proportional representation as an alternative to our current system in the US.  The capstone project requires time management, planning, organization, dedication, and focus, plus strong research, writing and presenting skills.  He has done very well with all stages thus far.  In April he will present the paper publically in a mini-defense.  The project also will be submitted to the Beacon Conference, a research competition for two-year college students.  In an effort to gain additional experience with presentations and conferences, Will submitted an abstract proposal to the Northeast Regional Honors Conference on the threat of nuclear weapon proliferation.   Happily, he was chosen to present his paper at the conference in April.  Additionally, he agreed to be a student presenter when my team-teaching partner and I present at a best teaching practices conference on March 1st.  He will be one of three students on our panel to discuss the experience, from faculty and student perspectives on team teaching for Honors: Introduction to Humanities 202.

Will’s eventual goal is to work for the US government, perhaps in embassies.  His interests in politics, history, culture and language should provide beneficial in that endeavor.  He has a solid grasp of many nuances of all of these areas, which will only grow as he continues his education and experiences. 

I highly recommend William Perez.  He has all of the qualities to succeed at a transfer institution: strong analytical skills; a passion for debate; the ability to listen and truly process what is being said; and the willingness to work hard to succeed.   As a first generation student, he knows and appreciates the importance of education, hard work and giving back.  He is a student with a great deal of potential who will bring as much to any college or program as he will gain from it.  He is very deserving of any transfer scholarships we can provide to help him on his path.  

Please feel free to contact me with any additional questions.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing on the behalf of Frank Bastone, a former student of mine at Orange County Community College.  

Frank enrolled in my Contemporary Health course in the spring of 2013, and is working toward obtaining his degree in Exercise Science.  Frank is very conscientious, and demonstrates a high level of self-motivation.  His quality of work and attention to detail far exceeded my expectations as an instructor.  Frank is looking forward to obtaining a career as an Athletic Trainer and Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist.  He is currently completing a pre-internship program through Winthrop University and has been working closely with athletic trainers from both SUNY Orange and the Newburgh Free Academy gaining valuable experience.  Frank also offered free coaching clinics for youth wrestlers over winter break following the completion of his capstone project evaluating current research on strength and conditioning programs in wrestling athletes.  Frank takes every opportunity to improve his skills and knowledge; he attended the 2013 Allied Health Symposium at Dominican College, and has completed continuing education classes through Exercise ETC Inc., obtaining a certification in High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).  In addition to his studies, Frank also maintains a part-time job working 20 hours each week.  Franks determination to succeed is admirable.  He is confident in his knowledge and has a strong passion to continue learning.  

I am honored to have the opportunity to write this recommendation for Frank.  He has worked very hard for all he has accomplished.  He is dedicated to his academics and puts his heart into everything he does.  I am confident he will succeed in all of his future endeavors.

She is strong student and someone worthy of consideration.

Karen joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program in the fall of 2012, exemplifying her commitment to push herself academically.  Though a bit younger than many of her classmates and rather shy initially, she has grown tremendously in the last two years.  At SUNY Orange, she is pursuing an Associates in Science degree (with a biology/pre-med concentration), with an Honors Program designation.   Her eventual academic goal is medical school.
 
As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as her academic advisor as well as her instructor for Honors: Freshman English I, Honors Service Learning and Honors Capstone I.  This spring, she is completing Honors Capstone II with me.  In class, Karen is always prepared and ready to learn.  Her assignments, whether reading, written or oral, always are complete and she has thought carefully about the material.  As a non-native speaker, writing and public speaking were areas in which she has continued to improve.   She now presents and participates in class much more confidently and this semester will be working on her interviewing skills.  Her strengths are in math and the sciences, yet she makes connections across disciplines and thinks and reads very critically.  Overall, Karen is not afraid to ask for help and is learning to take risks to improve and learn.  She possesses a great deal of academic curiosity; she enjoys learning, which adds to her growth and potential.  

The Honors Program requires a minimum of eighteen honors credits; Karen will graduate with 22.  One of the requirements is 45 hours of community service, which she had no difficulties completing, volunteering to check in people at blood drives, helping at Pets Alive Animal Sanctuary, and doing organizational work at her former high school’s swim meets.   This spring, she is tutoring two Honors Program students in biology.  She also helped at a College health fair, leading children in exercises and moving them through an obstacle course.  All of this has improved her confidence speaking in front of groups.  She also helps with all Honors Program fundraising activities.

Another honors requirement is our capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  She is exploring the possibilities of DNA manipulation, a rather intense, high-level scientific review of very new literature.  This project requires time management, organization, dedication, and focus, in addition to research, writings and presenting skills.  She is doing well with this two-semester project.  The paper will be presented and defended in April and submitted to the Beacon Conference, a research paper competition for two-year college students.  

In addition to her scholastic and service activities, Karen works ten to twelve hours a week, cleaning offices for Crystal Run HealthCare.  Outside of school, she has many home obligations. With all of these activities and responsibilities, she maintains a 3.73 GPA, which speaks to her determination, time management skills and academic abilities.  Overall, she is a very nice young woman with a great deal of potential.

I highly recommend Karen for any transfer scholarship we might offer.  As a first generation student, she truly understands the importance of education and hard work.  She will continue to grow as a student and person and will bring as much as she takes from any opportunity afforded to her.   I also know that any assistance we can provide will be very important to her and her family.

	I met Ms. Schaedlich in August 2013, when she was a student in my Calculus 1 class.  She quickly made an impression because she sat in the front row and, from the second day of class, distinguished herself as committed to excelling in this course.  Nicki’s notes were meticulous.  As I was teaching, she was careful to follow and understand, asking intelligent questions when needed.
	As the semester progressed, I could see that her quizzes and exams were as neat as her notes, showed mastery of knowledge, and provided evidence of completing assignments – which were not collected.
	Nicki aligned herself with other diligent students and together they worked on homework and reviewed for exams.  By the end of the semester, Ms. Schaedlich had earned a B-minus for the course, in a class where only one A was awarded.  (I suspect that with another instructor she may have received an A; my exams tend to be challenging.)
	As a professor, I can tell you that Nicole is a “dream student”.  She does everything asked of her and works hard, even when topics, quizzes, or exams are difficult.  She is also a pleasant, respectful person, one whom I would be happy to have as a student again.
	Outside of the classroom, Ms. Schaedlich is an athlete; she competed on the very successful SUNY Orange women’s volleyball team!

Danny is a rare student and highly motivated.  Of his own accord he decided to pursue an internship with the District Attorney’s office for credit this semester.   Ordinarily we place our students with the police, probation and the medical examiner for credit, however, Danny decided on his own to secure this internship based on his own interests.  We have never been able to place our students at this office but thanks to Danny he has opened the door to future internships.  This is the motivation that I am talking about.  He is a unique young man, always respectful and extremely dedicated.  As an important side note, Danny is the only student of mine in the past six years that wears a dress shirt and tie to school every day.  He works hard in three classes that he has had with me over the past year and devotes 100% of his effort to classroom assignments and discussions.  He is actively involved with the Criminal Justice Club in Newburgh and was a recipient of a scholarship last year.  He is planning to obtain his bachelor’s degree and then will apply to law school.

Brandy is one of those few students who actually elevate the level of the course through her contributions.  She always did so in a well-informed and courteous manner.  She set out challenging ideas, was able to integrate the texts into meaningful dialogue, and delivered several supplemental (i.e., ""extra credit"") reports in the course--which elevated not only her grade, but the overall knowledge of her peers.

In the Group Presentation project, she was the recognized leader and organizer, setting an example of excellence for the rest of the class.  She is eloquent, thoughtful, and diligent.

Joanna Dykeman has asked me for a letter of recommendation, which I am happy to provide.  She is a very strong student and someone very worthy of consideration.
Jo, who is a home-schooled student and the younger sister of one of our alumni, applied to and joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program in fall 2012.  The decision to join the program exemplifies her commitment to academics and her own quest for knowledge.  She quickly became an active participant and leader in our program.   At the start of her sophomore year, she was awarded a full tuition President’s Honors Program Scholarship based on her strong academics and commitment to the program.  As I have known her for several years, watching her mature into a confident young adult has been very fun for me.
 
As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as her academic advisor as well as her instructor for  Honors Freshman English I, Honors Contemporary Novel (in an accelerated format—seven novels in seven weeks), and Honors Capstone I.  This spring, she is taking Honors: Introduction to Philosophy and Capstone II with me.  In class, Joanna is always prepared and ready to learn.  Her assignments, whether reading, video, written or oral, are complete and she has carefully considered the material.  She makes connections across disciplines and thinks and reads critically.  She enjoys reading and discussing literature as well as working with the College’s theater department.  Her writing, while strong when she arrived, continues to develop as do her abilities to speak in group or presentation situations and facilitate discussions.  She possesses a great deal of academic curiosity; basically, she enjoys learning.  She asks thoughtful questions and is not afraid to ask for help or try a new idea.  She is an appropriate risk-taker, willing to try new things and test new ideas.  

At SUNY Orange, she is pursuing an Associate in Arts degree with an English concentration, and an Honors Program designation.  The honors designation requires a great deal of hard work and serious commitment to academic, cultural and social endeavors.  She is performing well in all areas. Her enthusiasm, work ethic (she can often be found studying with her peers) and friendly personality make her a natural leader in the Honors Program.  She spends time in our lounge, talking with both freshmen and sophomores, or in the quiet study area, preparing for classes.

The Honors Program requires a minimum of eighteen honors credits; Joanna should graduate with 28.  She prefers the student-centered Socratic discussion style and the smaller classes, but is equally adept in larger learning situations. One of the program requirements is 45 hours of community service, which she had no difficulties completing; she volunteered in the College’s lab school and theatre, worked at the library in her hometown and walked to raise money and awareness for breast cancer.  She currently serves as a peer mentor for the Honors Program and as an Honors Orientation leader this past fall.  For the former, she has five freshmen Honors students for whom she is responsible: maintaining regular contact with them and serving as a resource to help them through the all-important first semester adjustment to college and honors.  At Orientation, she helped plan and run activities and served on the student information panel.  She also helps with all of the program’s fundraising activities.

Another honors requirement is our capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  She is proving that other possibilities exist for the authorship of plays generally attributed to William Shakespeare.  This project requires time management, planning, organization, dedication, and focus, in addition to research, writing and presenting skills.  Currently, we are just over half-way through the project and her work has been consistently excellent. The paper will be presented and defended in April and also will be submitted to the Beacon Conference, a research paper competition for two-year college students.  In an effort to gain more experience with academic research and presentation, Joanna, as a freshman, submitted an abstract proposal to the Northeast Regional Honors Conference.  It was accepted and she presented on the importance of funding the arts in elementary and high school.  As part of that conference preparation, she helped fundraise to cover some of the expenses. This year, as a sophomore, her proposal to the NRHC on alternate forms of education for K-12 students, which are currently challenging the boundaries of the typical education model, was also accepted, so she will be our veteran presenter at that venue.  Also as a freshman, she presented at the Beacon Conference on philosophical theories found in the Star Wars movies.  Her capstone paper submission to Beacon will be her second there as well. 

Jo’s interest in the arts is very strong and influences all that she does.  She has worked behind the scenes as well as acted in the College’s theatrical productions.  She played Alice in the one-act play Eat Your Heart Out and has a role in the upcoming spring production. Additionally, she is an active member of the Apprentice Players club as well as the English Club, which Honors Program students created.  Many of her final projects and presentations are interdisciplinary, appropriately interweaving creativity and visuals with strong research and literary content.  She also is a member of the College’s Phi Theta Kappa chapter.  She also was given the Chancellor's Award for Student Excellence.

Outside of school, Joanna works 15-20 hours per week. With all of her activities both on off campus, she has maintained a 3.68 GPA, a testament to her determination, time management skills and academic abilities.  Overall, Joanna is a strong student who exemplifies those qualities instructors love to see: she is smart, funny, focused, interested in learning and willing to try any new opportunities that come her way. 

For all of these reasons, when our College’s Foundation Board accepted my offer to provide an Honors Program student to serve as an ex-officio student member (which had never been done prior), Joanna was the first person whom we recommended.  For the 2013-14 academic year, she is serving in this capacity, attending meetings and being mentored by the former Board president.  The Board members are very pleased with her maturity, thoughtfulness and willingness to acquire new skills and information.
 
Joanna has developed into a young woman of whom I am very proud.  I highly recommend her for any scholarship that might be available.  I know that she will represent herself, the Honors Program and our College very well.

I am acquainted with Moon because she was my student in Calculus 1 last semester and is currently taking Linear Algebra with me.	  She impressed me immediately with her work ethic and commitment to her education.  As I got to know her, I learned that she is a very mature, classy person.
	English is Moon’s second language and, at times, there is slight difficulty with communication.  However, she does not let that obstacle get in the way.  Overall, her comprehension is excellent and she always strives for perfection in writing and speaking.  In Calculus, she initially demonstrated that Math did not come “naturally” for her, but by the end of the semester, you’d never know it!  Because of her dedication and hard work, she was the only student in her class to earn a final grade of A.
	On a more personal note, Moon is a quiet young lady who slowly makes quality friends; both her classmates and instructors respect her.  Additionally, I have come to know her as a very appreciative person.  At the end of the Fall semester, she took the time to write a heartfelt thank-you note to me.  Moon is cheerful and is a “dream” student to teach.
	It is students like Moon that make SUNY Orange proud, and I know that the faculty and staff of any future educational institution that she attends would feel the same.

Amanda Quintana has asked me for a letter of recommendation, which I am happy to provide.   She is a solid student and worthy of consideration.

Amanda joined the SUNY Orange Honors Program in the fall of 2012, exemplifying her commitment to push herself academically.  She was one of our first class of honors students at our Newburgh campuses and has been a very active, participative student ever since.  
 
As the Coordinator of the Honors Program, I serve as her academic advisor as well as her instructor for Honors Seminar: Gender Roles, Honors Service Learning, Honors: Introduction to Philosophy, Honors: Intro to Humanities II, Honors Capstone I and current Honors Capstone II.  In class, Amanda is prepared and ready to participate.  Her assignments, whether reading, written or oral, are complete and she has thought carefully about the material.  Her writing continues to improve as does her confidence speaking in group or presentation situations.  In fact, she occasionally helps with Honors Program recruiting activities, speaking with prospective students and parents.  At SUNY Orange, she is pursuing an Associates in Arts degree, with a concentration in psychology and the Honors Program designation.  The honors designation requires hard work and a serious commitment to academic, cultural and social endeavors.  She is performing well in all areas.  Her instructors enjoy having her in class and her peers appreciate both her sense of humor and active involvement in activities.  She has become a leader in the Honors Program and on the Newburgh campus.

The Honors Program requires a minimum of eighteen honors credits, though students often chose to do more; she will graduate with thirty-three.  One of the requirements is 45 hours of community service, which she had no difficulties completing; she worked on a number of events including working with Safe Harbors, fundraising for breast cancer and autism awareness, and doing various walks.  Another honors requirement is our capstone project—similar to a college senior or master’s thesis, but at the sophomore level.  Amanda is exploring the negatives and positives of a college education.  This project requires time management, organization, dedication, and focus, in addition to research, writing and presenting skills.  She will submit the final paper in March and present the paper in April.   

She is even more active on campus.  She has served as the Newburgh Student Senate secretary, the Newburgh Board of Activities Vice President, a Student Ambassador for Admissions, a member of the Historia Club, and chair of the Semi-Formal Committee.  Additionally, she helps with recruiting for the Honors Program in Newburgh, serves as an Honors Program Peer mentor (responsible for guiding five freshmen through the all-important first year) and Honors Orientation leader.  She manages all of this and has maintained a 3.04 GPA.  Additionally, she was chosen as one of the College’s nominees for a Chancellor’s Award for Student Excellence.  Outside of school, Amanda is actively involved with her family in various community events and works in retail.  

Amanda is a wonderful young woman with a great deal to offer.  I highly recommend her for any scholarships for which she is qualified as I know finances are a serious concern for her family.  Additionally, she will represent the College and any organization with which she is connected in a positive manner.

Amanda has been a member of the Newburgh Board of Activities (BOA) and earned a Recognition Award for the Improvement of Campus Life in May 2013. This award is given to those who go above and beyond and enrich the quality of campus life.

February 18, 2014

I have had Kimberly Smith in my General Chemistry I class this past fall and she is currently taking my General Chemistry II class right now.  Kimberly is a quiet student who has not missed a single class and has never been late to class.  Chemistry is a very difficult subject for many of my students as it is a class that requires constant attention in that there is a lot of homework and quizzes topped off by tests and lab work.  Many of my students struggle to keep up with the volume of work and have a tendency to fall behind.  Kimberly does not fall into this category but always has her work done on time in both lecture and lab.  She is always prepared for lab with her lab book completed and done in an exemplary manner.  She is also always ready for the quizzes with an overall quiz average of around 90%.  She is a good solid student who has done well at SUNY Orange and should continue to do well when she transfers.  
Kimberly Smith is a strong student who works hard and has a dedicated work ethic which will serve her well as she moves through life.  I foresee no reason why she should not do well at her next institution of higher learning and; therefore, have no problem giving her my recommendation should you have any questions I can be reached at timothy.macmahon@sunyorange.edu

It is with pleasure that I recommend Paulina Pavese for a graduating scholarship.   I have had Paulina in several classes over the past year and each semester she proves to be an intellectual asset to my classes.  She is always prepared for class discussions and goes above and beyond what is required.

In addition, to being on the Dean's List and doing well academically, Paulina is a devoted member of her community.  She is a volunteer fire woman and EMT for the Monticello Fire Department. She works as a tutor at her local high school and also works as a lifeguard, ski instructor and for an ambulance company in her community.  

She is perhaps one of the nicest students that I have had over the years and is always willing to help out her classmates in any way that she can.  In addition, Paulina took the time to find herself an internship at a law office this past summer in preparation for attending law school after she receives her bachelor's degree.   She is highly motivated and often takes the initiative.  

Should you have any questions on this applicant, please do not hesitate to contact me at janine.sarbak@sunyorange.edu or at 341-4348.

During this time, I have also worked with Kyle on a project he wished to introduce at our college’s SOARS program.  Kyle’s work in this regard was exceptional and exhibited the most clear evidence for his analytical depth and potential as a prospective student for continuing his undergraduate career. Kyle has also worked as a tutor in our college’s Tutorial Center for both of the classes he took with me. This is significant as he is one of a very few students who have ever taken both of my courses and passed with straight A’s.  In this regard, Kyle has shown himself to be a student with unlimited potential as he has been able to master all of the material and coursework at this level of his college experience. 

Mr. Miller is not an average student in that his background speaks volumes about his character and ability to tackle extraordinary challenges. His military training has taught him to be organized, structured and successful. However, this experience has also allowed him to use this maturity to bring a perspective to his learning and interests that have a philosophical and macro-level focus to understand the most complex and life-affirming subjects. 

 In closing, Mr. Miller is the rare student who symbolizes what learning is truly about: to have a driven desire to understand the world around him and willingness to explore and learn deep philosophical questions for the sake of learning and not just the ability to market these interests into employment opportunities.  It is my hope that Kyle is given the highest priority for scholarship for a graduating student as he has exhibited the highest potential for success of any student I have taught and deserves our support to facilitate his future success.
