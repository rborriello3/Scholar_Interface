Over this past summer, 2013, I became a Certified Nursing Assistant, and have since worked at Campbell Hall Rehabilitation Center as a CNA. I initially started out as full time but have since dropped down to 30 hours a week to meet the demands of nursing school. I live with my fiance and together we do the best we can to keep up with monthly bills. Unfortunately, due to the rigorous demands of work and school, I have little time for extracurricular activities.","Now that I have completed more than one year of college, I cannot say enough as to how I have grown as a student and person. I earned a Bachelor's Degree from SUNY Brockport in 2008 and worked in the business world up until 2012 when I realized that I was not happy where I was in life. I took a good look in the mirror and realized the problem was me, not my job or where I was living. I was not happy with where I was in life because I had not gone to school to pursue something that had really interested me. I made the decision to go back to school for nursing because all my life there were people that always tried to help me to reach my full potential in all aspects of my life and I was too young, too naive and too immature to listen to them regardless of how much more knowledge they had than I did. Now I want to give back and help people when they are at their most vulnerable; when they are sick and diseased. As a student, I have become excellent at time management skills and actively listening to instruction. Every minute of classroom time is an opportunity for learning to take place and I have truly gotten to understand and appreciate that. As a person I have made giant leaps and bounds. I now possess the confidence as an adult that I once lacked because I have shown myself that once I put my heart and mind into doing something, the possibilities are endless. Two years ago, when I looked in that mirror I saw nothing that resembled who I am today. Back then I barely thought I had a chance of getting in to the nursing program. Now, when I look in the mirror I see a confident, focused and determined nursing student with only one year of school left. It is hard to believe what two years has done for me but I am grateful for the opportunity and I look forward with optimism to what tomorrow has to offer.","PRYLUCK (SHEPARD & EDNA) SCHOLARSHIP (2013-2014 Recipient)

In addition, I clean office buildings five days a week after school which I have been doing everyday since 2010. Finally, I take care of my mother, who is 69 years old with crippling rheumatoid arthritis. ","       Now that I have completed one year of college,  I feel I have an accomplished comprehension of the physiological and biological relationships of diseases and their hosts, moreover, I realize my roll as a future dental hygienist and the important impact on my community that I will be making to it. Overall for those reasons, I feel enlightened because my experiences made me into a better student and professional.     

       The past year I have committed my time in such classes as, Biochemistry, Preventive Oral Health Services, and Maxillary Anatomy & Oral Histology. My classes broke down my world into electrons, protons and neutrons, and slowly built it back into a double helix of DNA which my chemistry professor had illustrated so elegantly. Then in my anatomy and oral histology class my professor revealed to me how DNA replicates to become cells, tissues and vital organs which she used this process to teach me Embryology; I went through all nine mouths of prenatal development in this class. At this point, I learned how the human body develops, and I grasped what normal embryological development looks like versus abnormal development. I understand now how those embryonic anomalies such as, a cleft palate, or spina bifida can have a significant impact on the health condition of a developing fetus. We of course also went over with intense detail the circulatory system, hormone system, and the nervous system of the head and neck.       

       While in Preventive Oral Health Services, I became well informed on many other diseases of the body for instance, gonara, tuberculosis, and herpes zoster just to name off a few. I was also introduced to the use of universal precautions which helps me to protect myself by wearing personal protective gear that is a barrier between me and my patients which protects us both from a possibility of a multitude of harmful microbes that we could potentially come in contact or can invade our immune  systems. The second lesson I received from this class is how to properly operate my dental instruments for use in the dental field. I went through many long days and hours practicing, and tried to increase my tactile sense. Ultimately I learn that there is a direct oral systemic link to the body for example the cardiac health of a patient can be at risk of the same bacteria in their mouth by traveling through the blood to the mitral valve of the heart which can induce many unwanted possibly fatal activities to that patient. I am grateful to have this knowledge because if I can save one life, I maybe saving someone's mother, father, sister, brother and doing good for others is the key to happiness. 

       I now have a capable perception of the physiological and biological associations of diseases and their hosts; I also realize my position as a forthcoming dental hygienist and the crucial impact on my community that I will make to it. Largely for those reasons, I feel fortunate because my experiences in my completion of the past year in college helped me grow into a superior student and professional.

Before attending college I truly believed this was an unattainable dream. I have learned the true value of quality education, which I hope to pass on to my daughter. Attending college has been thus far an empowering achievement considering I am the first person in my family to have enrolled in college. 	
	Through the courses that I have assisted in the past year, I have acquired valuable knowledge pertaining to oral health, also I am learning how to make that information applicable to everyday life in order to improve ones over all health, as was well as the health of current and future patients. I have learned how to communicate with people in order to educate them on how much of an importance it is to maintain  a healthy mouth and how that contributes to their over all heath status. 
	In order to effectively teach and educate a patient on oral health values I had to learn to break out of my shell. I am generally a very shy, none assertive person. I feel that in order for to make an ever lasting change and have a patient be receptive to information being given to them, one must exert confidence in their knowledge and in them selves as future professionals. This past year has given me just that. With the help of my professors and instructors I have been able to mold into a self- assured woman. Not just noticeable in school as a clinician but also as a woman in every day life situations.

At my first job I am a nursing assistant in the Critical Care Unit of a hospital. My second job is in my home. Here I am a mother, wife, grocery shopper, chef, dry cleaner, accountant, gardener, maid, taxi driver and tutor. No where in my job description was ""student"" listed. The thought of going back to college was just that, a thought. How could I possibly return to school after sixteen years of being away? Did I even possess the academic abilities needed to secure a college education? After all, I was now forty and my life had changed drastically during those years. It was no longer my own but my family's. As time went on and my children started to grow up my role in life started to change. I was relieved of my taxi driving duties and my tutoring services were no longer needed. It was time to make that thought a reality and add student to my job description. 

I will never forget how overwhelmed I felt those first few days of class. I truly felt I had made a mistake and I wanted to give up. But my husband and children told me that quitting was not an option and with their support and encouragement I went on. It has been four years since I entered the doors of SUNY Orange as a student and I have flourished. I made the Dean's List in the Fall 2013 semester and was asked to join the Honor Society, which I will be inducted into on April 4, 2014. I have applied for the Dental Hygiene program and am hopeful to obtain one of the twenty seats available.

Mother to 7 year old ","Throughout my childhood I always saw myself becoming an ER doctor.  I saw myself running down the hallway to respond to a code or cracking someone's chest open in the ER to save their life.  But during my senior year at Pace University, my father fell ill.  He required assistance and close monitoring as well as continuous medical treatment and testing.  Due to family circumstances, I had to step up as the primary care giver.  This meant putting my medical dreams on hold.  Three years later I was still waiting.  At this point in my life, I decided I needed to re-evaluate my career path.  Working as a healthcare provider was not going to change.  I want to be in the hospital setting and work in emergency situations; so what better way than a nurse.
After completing my degree at Suny Orange, I want to attend Scranton University.  During my attendance, I will complete my master's degree as either a nurse anesthetist or a nurse practitioner.  I want to graduate with honors and in the top 5% of the class with a job offer at either Orange Regional Medical Center or Scranton Hospital.  Hopefully, one day I will be able to fulfill my dreams of becoming a medical doctor.  But until that time comes, working as a registered nurse anesthetist or nurse practitioner will fulfill my professional goals.

","There were three long years between me and the early summer day that I threw my cap in the air. For most graduates that day the exuberance centered on college life, dormitory living, and new beginnings.  For me, to be painfully honest, my excitement was a disguised relief; relief in the illusion of freedom.  Freedom from high school, freedom from homework, and freedom from stress.

I’d managed to get through high school, all the while reassuring myself that college was not for me. I sold myself short. Yet no sooner was high school in my rear view mirror than reality began to settle, at first lightly on my mind and then very heavily on my conscience. Of course, I needed to go to college. Everything I wanted, for myself or for others, would have to begin with college.  

I am standing at the front door, on the first day with three years between me and the last time I sat in a classroom. Yet something very different became of something I thought would be so painfully familiar. I stepped into SUNY Orange and the three years behind me dissolved into the first day of the future ahead of me. My professors have taught me valuable skills that have aided in my progression as a student and a person.

Without hesitation, I can complete essential and advanced math formulas that are critical for the workplace. Articulating entire papers was once a great challenge; it’s now part of my everyday life, a skill that will prove useful in any workplace. My college experience has taught me more about myself than any past experience; I had no idea how comfortable I was in front of a crowd, or how excited I am to write about topics I am passionate about. I learned that I will study all night for that “A,” and that I always treat extra-credit as mandatory, two things that did not accompany me during high school. 

My four semesters at SUNY Orange have helped me understand how much time was lost during high school, although I now have solace in knowing I am on the right track. My previous dismay of schooling was soon forgotten when it became clear that education was not just to appease a parent or a school system, it was to better myself in a way that would allow me to continue my journey through this world in a meaningful way. I think this understanding is what has changed me and my views the most.

Education is accompanied by new ways to see the world, the people around you, and yourself. I am nearly done with this chapter of my life and am eager to continue my education upon my graduation.

It is a large part of a students life and whether they are ready or not they are expected to grow. Growing is part of the process of being a college student. My first year of college taught me a lot. Some of the things I learned are maturity, responsibility, and making the right decisions. 
	College forced me to mature, gain responsibility, and make correct choices. When I first began college I was not expecting to be so independent and have so many responsibilities. Not only was I going to school but I was also working part time. I had to attend class everyday because by missing just one lesson I would fall behind. I could not wait until last minute to do my work because there was so much it was impossible to wait. I had to make my own financial decisions, such as separating my wants from my needs. I no longer could spend money on items that I did not need because I had to save up for textbooks and school supplies. I had to become responsible for my own work because teachers did not chase after me to get my work done. I could not afford completing work late because so many points are taken off. I learned that the earlier the work the better the outcome. I always had to do my work on time and try my hardest because the rules are stricter in college. I had to make the right decisions, such as hanging out with the right people, never skipping class, and not attending all night parties or engage in illegal and inappropriate behavior. An example of making the right decisions is when my friends wanted to spend time with me and my homework was not done, I had to say no because school work comes first. School to me is always more important, and within the first year of college I grew up so much. 
	Growing up is a part of being a college student. It not only changes the student emotionally but also mentally and it prepares them for the real world. To me my first year of college taught me to be mature, responsible, and to always make the right choices. ",,Checked

As a student, this year I have learned that being responsible is the key to success. This has helped me to be more responsible with my school work and my classes. Also, it has helped me to realize that getting things done on time, such as homework, can help me in my future jobs. For example, I want to be a graphic designer. What if I get a job doing a company´s logo and they tell me a specific date that they want the logo to be done; the date comes and I didn’t get the logo done. They are not going to give me a second chance to get it done, instead, they are going to think that I’m irresponsible and might end up firing me. But, if I get the logo done on time they are going to think that I’m responsible with my work and might ask me to do more  designs for them in the future. Sometimes, we don’t realize how a small task , such as getting homework completed on time, can help us in the future. 
As a person, I have learned that no matter how old you are, what color you are, or in my case, if you are an illegal immigrant or not, if we want to become someone in life we have to look for ways to get what we want. Going to college has been one of the toughest decision I have ever made because many people told me that illegal immigrant students couldn’t go to college and also that I wouldn’t be able to handle the college work. when i first started college i was afraid of whether or not i belonged there because i didn't consider myself as college material and also because i was an illegal immigrant. But now that I’m going to finish my fourth  semester, I can tell these people that illegal immigrant students can go to college and also that I can handle college work. Up to this day, I can say that I made the right decision to get into college to get the education I need to become a graphic designer. although i know it won't be easy because as an illegal immigrant i have a lot of obstacles, such as getting a job after i graduate, but i'm  determined to overcome those obstacles and to succeed even more after my second year of college, and matured as a person by learning to go for what i want and not listen to negativity around me.

While these experiences delayed my immediate goals, they made a profound impact on my outlook on life. I entered the OTA program because I was looking for a career where I could make an impact on someone else's life. Instead, the impact was on my own. During my recuperation time, I started to think about my life in a different light. What if all these upheavals were actually just that-up! Elevating me towards something greater than I could have imagined at the get go, I needed these experiences to understand, relate and empathize with individuals in a more valuable way. These lessons have further instilled in me the importance of viewing the whole person. The holistic approach to occupational therapy is not only necessary, but the driving force to elevate each individual to their goal.  Within this past year, I have grown physically, emotionally and spiritually. Although my life this past year has churned and changed course much like a river, I would not change the course. There is much to be learned both in times of drought and overflow - perseverance and thankfulness. Life is not solely about what you become, but how you accomplish the tasks and goals necessary to arrive at your desired destination. My goal is to become an OTA and my destination is endless.

We will be hosting a general meeting this month.","Being a college student comes with numerous responsibilities: class attendance, papers, studying for exams, projects, and internships.  For a lucky few, that is the extent of their responsibilities.  For most others, like myself, school is yet another thing to be factored into the chaos of our lives.  As a full-time college student the added responsibility has helped me to become better at multitasking and prioritizing. In order to multitask effectively, prioritizing has been another helpful skill that I have had to master.  Considering the fixed stressors in my life, and the occasional way that life seems to throw things off course, I have found that prioritizing is absolutely necessary for success. 
	My mother has suffered from severe mental illness for most of my life; Dad always worked a full time job in New York City.  With two younger siblings, a lot of adult responsibility was left to me because my mother’s illness and medications hindered her competence as a mother.  Now that we are older, and my mother is no longer at home with us, it seems that I have been left with much more responsibility.  In between homework and working six days a week, I manage my family’s finances and do the family shopping.  On weekends when my fourteen year old sister comes home from my Grandmother’s -- where my father thought she would be best and moved her in the fall-- we spend time together and often have to shop for things that she needs.  The family shopping is usually done on a weekend day so that purchases can also be made for my sister.  This can be time consuming and includes grocery and amenity purchases, school supplies and sometimes clothes for my little sister.  In addition to my home and work life which require much of my attention, school is just another important factor.   This has just made my ability to multitask even greater--a valuable skill that will benefit me long term.  
 Focusing on one thing at a time, in order of importance, has helped me to get assignments in on time so that I have been able to make the Dean's list every semester.  Prioritizing things in the order in which they need to be done has also helped me to pay bills on time, and manage my time so that I am prepared for school, work, and home.  Organizing my “free time” helps me to get these things done.  Managing the finances has been a challenge to my prioritizing skills.  Because the finances concern my entire family, it is important that the money be spent in order of priorities.  This means that certain bills must be paid at a specific time in the month to ensure that there are available funds for other bills and necessities such as groceries and car maintenance.  
My multitasking and prioritizing skills have substantially improved  since I started school.   Having to balance, school, work, and my personal life have challenged these abilities and made them stronger.  This experience has helped me to be a better student and an organized and responsible adult.

","Before college, I was already faced with many hardships. Particularly, my father passing away when I was 16; it was an extremely difficult time for my family and I. We had to stretch every single dollar we had, along with the emotional stress that burdened us with our father's passing. As time went by, I noticed my mother struggling with raising all four children. In-spite of being a full time student and employee; I took on the task of helping with my younger brother. He was incredibly stubborn, which made it even harder and stressful on me. As soon as I would come home from work or school, I would make sure that he was being that respectful young man he should be. I want my brother to look up to me, and see what he can become if he sets his mind to it. College is a big priority that I want to excel in. I spend every single hour I have available preparing or studying for my classes. Losing sleep because of school taught me to become even more careful on what I spend my extra time on. Juggling school, work and family can be a very daunting task; however, it made me the person I am today. College is definitely a reality check for me; it helped me become a more organized, mature, independent person.  As soon as a schedule is set for a semester, I have to either grow up and prioritize, setting all of 'partying' aside, or do the bare minimum in my courses. It's an experience that can easily make or break a person. School is without a doubt is going to make an indecisive person, decisive. It makes a person actually think about the consequences and rewards of doing a certain action. Studying equals, lost hours of sleep and socializing, but a better grade on a exam. All of the time put into college is worth it, for it's a ticket to receiving a career that is yearned for. With all of the responsibilities that are placed upon me, I take it as an opportunity to become a stronger person.","

-Babysitting for Family throughout the years","       My senior year of high school, I was surrounded by boys in the New Visions Engineering program. I was never a shy student. Raising my hand in class did not scare me, even if I wasn’t completely sure of my answer. The one thing I hadn’t counted on at New Visions was being outnumbered 3 to 14 by the opposite sex. My first year at OCCC has been no different. At the beginning of the year, there were at least 60 boys to 4 girls in the freshman engineering program. 
	It’s true that women and men are equal in our society. We have the chance at the same opportunities and we are afforded the same rights. Engineering is one of the most predominantly male fields, and I expected to face at least a little adversity in my career choice, but I did not expect it to be so daunting. My gender does not change the fact that I spend hours upon hours each week making sure that I understand the source material as thoroughly as possible. It does not make me less capable of understanding the 2 three hours labs I take part in each week. It does, however, mean that all the work I put into my education is not the end. I also have to strive to prove myself, not only to myself, but to the boys around me who undermine my right to be in the program. 
	The teasing I encounter is never malicious, but it has always made me feel as though I need to prove myself in order to be accepted in the male dominated program, and in the engineering world in general. I found myself pressured to step up in ways that I didn’t see my male colleagues thinking about. No one ever questioned their intelligence or capability to succeed. 
	Our society has perpetuated the image of women as homemakers. There is nothing wrong with that, but I do not feel as though my desire to be an engineer should be questioned due to the family or children I might one day have. My passion for math and science is no less than the passion my male peers feel. I am equally as proud to be where I am, and my gender should not overshadow that.
	This year I’ve grown in many ways, but most importantly I’ve become confident in my abilities. The realization that my battle to succeed in this field would be more difficult than the ones most of my male peers would face led me to find courage within myself. I no longer experience moments of self-doubt about what I am doing with my life. While it is absolutely difficult at times, I am always sure that I love it, and that it is the right path for me to take. 
When I take a physics test, I no longer spend time worrying about proving myself to others.
        My drive to get an A is not to prove myself, but to further my own future, for my own personal goals. The As that I strive so hard to receive are no longer to ensure my worthiness in the eyes of others, but rather to ensure the spot I deserve – becoming successful in a field where the odds are stacked against me, and inspiring other girls and women to do the same.

-As I stated English is my second language. I can not participate in many community service activities, because work, home life and college have been my major responsibilities.
","     I would like to introduce myself to the scholarship committee at SUNY ORANGE. Now that I completed one year of college, I will tell you how I have grown as a ESL student and as a determined person.
    My name is Olha Cheparska-Berean. I was born in the Ukraine and came to the United States in 2001. In the Ukraine I graduated from a Technical Institute, received degree in engineering and worked at an estimate's office in a metallurgical plant.
    When I came to the United States, my knowledge of the English language was very limited. I decided to take action and change my life. In 2002 I attended BOCES in Newburgh. By applying much effort toward my education, I was able to complete my GED in one and a half years and started to prepare for future college education.
     It was a difficult decision to attend SUNY ORANGE, because English is my second language and I graduated from high school thirty years ago. Studying didn't come easy for me. I held a full time job, took care of my household and raised my son. I also helped my son with his schooling. I sacrificed every minute of my free time toward studying. I was rewarded for all this hard work and had done well in all my courses. This success provided me with increased confidence and inspiration to accomplish my goals.
     Presently I am working on getting an OTA degree. This profession is familiar to me, because I work at school in the OT department. I find it very rewarding working with children, helping them to achieve their maximum potential, so they can function as independently as possible. My dream is to apply my work experience and college knowledge to help people in need.
       After sharing information about how I have grown as a ESL student and determined person, I hope outcome will be positive. To continue toward the OT program, I will eventually have to leave employment and devote my time to studying. This will limit my financial situation due to increased cost of and education. I would appreciate any assistance the scholarship committee could give me.",,Checked

My aunt (who happens to be my dad’s twin) currently suffers from stage IV breast cancer which has spread to her brain. This has taken a toll on the family as my father has become her primary care giver. I have done my best to relieve him on weekends and days off whenever possible which proves difficult due to the hour and a half commute it takes to reach them. I also do the same for my mother who bares the brunt of caregiving for my grandfather who is unfortunately developing his own mental status dysfunction. 

        I work per diem at New Hope Community in a behavioral house where I assist others in activities of daily life and encourage personal growth. I also work part time at SUNY Orange’s Wellness Center handling an assortment of tasks for the nurses and administrators. 
","        As I reflect on the past year it feels as though a decade has gone before me.  It was only in my wildest dreams that I imagined being accepted into the SUNY Orange Nursing Program as I am a New Jersey native. The grades spoke for themselves but I knew only ten percent of non-state residents get in. And I did. Being accepted not only precipitated my nursing education, but it afforded me the opportunity to move away from the city and adopt the lifestyle I had been yearning for.

       While visiting a friend in Ulster County, I had made priceless friendships and met the man of my dreams. I wanted more than anything to move to New York. I was accepted into the nursing program of my choice in New Jersey; although, my heart wasn’t in it. I was living in my hometown of Little Ferry which Sandy managed to flood without rain. Yes, the town flooded by leaky levees- sewage overflow.  When I got the letter from SUNY Orange, I nearly dropped to my knees I was so grateful.  Needless to say, within a month’s time my bags were packed.  In my personal time since then, I have learned how to cook healthy meals for myself, safely and accurately handle a compound bow, reel in a fish, and take the time out to genuinely appreciate the nature I am surrounded by. I will cherish these memories for a lifetime. 

        Along with lifelong sentiments, I have been granted the education to become a member of one of the country’s most respected professions. I am going to be an R.N. Nothing raises bumps on my arms more than that thought. I have always been an excellent student, sacrificing for my studies and diligently working ahead of schedule, but it wasn’t until I was twenty-five that I realized I wanted to be a nurse. I put that heartfelt plan into action and here I am one year into nursing school. A natural in the context of bedside manner, I have learned so much about safety and patient rights which I intend to uphold. I have developed skills inclusive of (but not limited to) taking vital signs properly, administering medications (orally, intramuscularly and intravenously), changing sterile dressings, catheterization and effective utilization of various medical technologies. 

        I am confident in my ability to succeed as this first year has galvanized my passion for clinical experience and continuing education. I have, and continue to weather the mental storm that is nursing school as time management is put to the test, as are all relationships with friends and family.  I have learned how to bridge the gap between critical thinking and application time through practice in the clinical setting. I look forward to embracing the challenges that next year promises.

I went to their house a couple days a week to help her with homework and to make sure she understood everything being taught. They also have a son who is battling cancer so I helped the family with anything they needed being that they're going through a hard time. I went to Dunkin Donuts to help raise money for the safe harbors in November. A group of us sat at the drive thru and asked people to donate to a good cause and we were able to raise a sufficient amount of money. I went to the walk for autism and participated in it. A family friends daughter has autism so I went to the walk to become more aware of autism and to walk to help raise money for the cause. It was a great learning experience for me. I volunteered at a school bakery at Washingtonville Highschool. A family friend teaches the special education class and they have a bakery where they sell all kinds of baked goods to students. I volunteered and helped them pass out the goods and made sure they were giving the right amount of change back. I also helped set up the bakery and clean it up at the end. As far as outside obligations I have a job at a daycare in New Windsor called Little Sunshine Daycare. I work there three days a week and it is a great learning experience for me. Interacting with young children teaches you a lot. I also babysit two girls two days a week after I have gone to school and work. ","As a senior in high school, the last thing I wanted to do was stay home and attend a community college. I was convinced I wanted to go away so I applied to many schools. As my senior year went on I started to think that maybe going away for school wasn't the best idea. Since I have enrolled at SUNY Orange I realized that staying home was the best decision for me. 
Since I have completed a year of college I have matured and grown as a student. In high school, school was not my main priority. My social life was my main priority and I did not put forth my best effort all of the time. Now that I'm in college, that is not the case. School is my main priority and I put my best effort in at all times. I pay attention in all of my classes and make sure to ask any questions when I don't understand something. In high school procrastination was a big problem for me. I found myself up late at night doing homework the night before it was due much too often. It was very stressful and not a good decision. In college I have avoided procrastination and I now do my homework ahead of time so I avoid stress. If I know I have a test coming up I start studying ahead of time and make sure I understand all of the material. I spend a sufficient amount of time in the library studying and there is nothing to distract me so I can fully focus. I also keep in contact with all of my teachers to make sure my grades are good and that I am not behind in anything.  By attending community college I am able to fully focus on school and put forth my best effort. 
I have also matured as a person and grown after completing a year of college. In high school, I wanted to go away to college so I could be on my own and do whatever I wanted. When I look back now, that would have been the wrong decision. I was undecided about my major and by attending SUNY Orange I was able to get a feel for different classes and decide on a major. I chose occupational therapy because I realized I like the medical field and, I love helping people. By maturing and growing as a person I was able to pick a major and decide what I want to pursue for the rest of my life. In high school, I never saved money and always spent it on unnecessary things. Since I have been at college, I now have a job at a daycare and I also babysit. Half of my paychecks go in the bank and the other half is for gas and things that are important. I have learned to save my money and think twice before I spend it on something stupid. As I said before my social life is not a main priority for me anymore which is also another example of how I have changed as a person. I have put aside the less important things and learned to make school and work my main priorities. 
In conclusion, completing college for a year has definitely changed me not only as a student but as a person. I have matured a sufficient amount since the beginning of college and I have changed for the better. Attending SUNY Orange has helped lead me down the right path to success and I plan to continue down the path for my next year of college.",,Checked

I have attended 4 other colleges in the past finally landing a job in finance company based in California. I jumped on the move right away since I was a displaced hurricane Katrina victim. After 7 years, I found myself settling into a job that I was not happy with. As a result of not striving for the best academic experience I found myself at a crossroads in life about going back to school. I finally decided to forgo the criticisms of my family and ultimately the criticisms of myself, of not being intelligent enough, or good enough, and came back to school to pursue what I have always wanted to do.
Throughout, this year I have put more time and energy into my nursing classes than I did in all the years of college and colleges I have attended. I am aware that the Nursing program is highly competitive and I am striving for excellence, so I can graduate this difficult  program. As a RN I will continue to strive for excellence, and use what I have learned academically, to become the best nurse possible.
As a person, I have grown this year by not allowing other peoples criticisms or my own criticisms to hinder my success. I have come to the realization that I am the one who determines my future, not my family, academic advisors or peers. As a student I have grown this year by being able to pinpoint the best way that I learn and overcoming the obstacles set before me, Such as tutoring, study groups, me, and really putting in the effort to make education a large part of my life. I feel that I have had a very positive experience here at SUNY Orange this past year and l hope it continues, until my goal of becoming a Nurse and ultimately a nurse practitioner.

As I entered OCCC my freshman year I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. In high school I did really well in my sciences class but I wasn't sure if I’d do well in college. I took a Biology class my first semester and excelled in it. Not only did I do well, I loved the class. That's when I knew I wanted to go into a field involving science. I finally made the decision to become a Pharmacist. I knew in order to meet this goal I had to exceed in all my classes and maintain a high GPA. I also knew that it would be a lot of hard work and mental focus to complete this task. I have completed two math courses with A’s and three science classes with high B’s. Academically, I had figured out my passion in school.  Outside of school things were falling into place as well. Aside from all the time I put in my studies, I also had to maintain a part time job. Knowing that I wanted to be a Pharmacist, I got a perfect job at Rite-Aid as a Health Ambassador. I finally found a job similar to what I wanted to become. Having this job and also attending school taught me how to manage my time wisely. Sometimes at work, while on my break, Id study for exams that I knew were coming up. My life became school and work, work and school and I loved it. Completing my first year of college has taught me a lot about who I want to be in life, and what the necessary steps are to get there.

","I can't honestly answer this question, mostly because I have grown as a person, not just in the past year, but in the past 3 years at OCCC. As a young, single parent, I made the decision to return to school in the fall of 2011. (I had previously attended OCCC, but, I was young, and squandered my time, resulting in me returning to school with a GPA below 1.5.) I took night classes, and I worked on the nights I didn't have class, waiting tables to pay for my education. In the spring of 2012, I got my acceptance letter into the nursing program. In the fall, I began the Spartan Race that is the nursing program. My son is now almost three, and I still work every night. Many of my friends have dropped out or failed in the program. I refuse to consider that possible outcome for me personally. I guess the most important thing I have taken away from these past 3 years (other than my incredible ability to simultaneously study, eat, convince a 3 year old to get dressed, and put my shoes on) is to be strong. There have been times I have wanted to quit. Just crawl into bed, pull up the covers, and sleep for a week. But I haven't. I work 40 hours a week, I'm a single mom, and I am surviving Nursing II.  My GPA is now over 3.0, and I have never been more proud of myself. And yes, I am tired, I am stressed, and I am financially unstable. But I am strong. And I am Proud. And I am a good Mom.

I am married, have a 1 year old son, and expect the birth of my daughter within the next two months.","Since I began my academic adventure at SUNY Orange, my total abilities and skills have grown dramatically. I am better at time management and my self-confidence has grown. In addition, due to the mentorship of two professors who I have had the privilege of studying with, I have gained a better attitude toward my chosen career of management. In addition to these areas, I have also learned to balance the demands of school, work, volunteering, and my small but growing family.
I have learned exactly how important it is to learn the skill of time management. As I described above, the many demands that I deal with on a daily basis have forced me to learn when and how to spend my time. In addition of juggling sixteen credits of course work with thirty-six hours of week of work, twelve hours as a volunteer and countless nights awake with my one year old son, I have also learned to make time for an extra-curricular activity, which will enhance my resume as I move forward in my career.
My self-confidence has been boosted simply by the fact that I am in school and achieving little successes. Until I came to school, many of the things I attempted to do ended in failure. Having grown used to failure, I was almost afraid to succeed. However, even the minor successes I have had up until this time, like scoring well on challenging exams and papers, have enabled me to accomplish bigger things at home and at work.
Finally, my attitude toward management, once defined by a past mentor as “arrogant and autocratic” has been molded into something better described as “compassionate leadership”. There is nothing I love more than leading – not for the power itself. I love to see people succeed and help them along the way. Previously, as a misguided young person, I thought that I could force people to succeed, but now, due largely to the management courses that I am taking, I am able to have a proper attitude. I will be a better leader in the future due to the education I have already received.
The things that I have learned here at the college – time management, self-confidence, and compassionate leadership – will help me throughout my career and for the rest of my life.",,Checked

The education I have received thus far has taken me to an understanding of people and an outlook of the community to share my learned knowledge with them.  I am currently a Nursing II student learning about the care needs of people and the community as a whole.  Taking care of patients in the hospital and attending to their needs with education for their acute illness and how to improve their overall health is a rewarding opportunity.   Listening to their stories and connecting the dots to bring a well rounded approach to their needs to improve their current health status and the patients appreciation supersedes many of late nights and the need for caffeine to be pumped into my veins.  Helping people to get back to their ideal health status and normal daily activates has made for a positive impact on me personally.  
     Each day I approach my education with an open mind for growth with determination to improve my overall personal level and mind set to help others improve themselves.  There is not a day that goes by I do not try to help someone.  Vacation from caring for others is not on my calendar.  Listening, learning, sharing and caring for others are a huge part of my Nursing practice which I will build my personal best on.  If there is only one person a day I can help it is better than not helping someone at all.

Each day as they grow into beautiful responsible women the reflection is one of a caring environment I have raised them in.  I look forward everyday to new challenges with arms wide open.

","              My Growth as a Student and a Person After a Year of College

     Every day, books and magazines praise strong women of every age who accept challenges and win their battles. The rest of us read about these modern heroines, filled with awe and envy. We read, we dream a little, and then we go back to our lives. We gather knowledge every day from our human interactions, but only the lucky ones find an inspiration and start progressing at a faster, more exciting rate. My inspiration to start school again came from knowledgeable, smart women who came into my life. Although being in my forties officially categorizes me as a grownup, I found a lot of space to grow in patience and courage. 
      Patience was never my strongest virtue and I knew I would need it when I started my first English class. The fact that college would also be my first English-speaking school was worrying me. My teacher was gracious and kind, but she could not hide her disappointment when she read my first written paragraph. It clearly showed that my high school days were not only far in time, but far in space and language. I did not let my fear stop me and I shared my worries with her. That little show of courage set the start of my happy learning career. I wrote and she corrected until my writing was perfect. My English teacher gave me wings. She helped me grow not only my patience, but the little courage I showed when I asked for help.
     Since then, I have had the privilege to learn from many brilliant teachers. I met a lot of wonderful people of all ages. I made friends, I helped and was helped. After a year of college, by growing my patience and courage, I grew in confidence. I am still inspired by, but no longer envious of the women who make it onto the magazine covers. I am happier and I believe in my own strengths.

During my first and second semester of nursing school (Fall of 2013/ Spring of 2014), I attended many hours of stimulating lectures and classes, learned important clinical skills, and practiced nursing care in a variety of healthcare settings. With the assistance of OCCC's highly educated and devoted nurse educators, I have gained considerable knowledge and understanding of what it takes to be a nurse and the commitment required to excel in this rewarding profession. I have gained a deeper respect and admiration for all those who work day and night in the health care setting, and this learning experience has been unforgettable as I devote my every waking hour to be the best I can be in this field. In striving to be successful and achieve academic excellence, I've also maintained a high GPA (3.7) and continue to be a full-time member of Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and my college’s nursing club. As a busy mother of three, I have also learned to balance both my scholastic priorities and my family’s responsibilities through essential time management skills.  I believe that with earning this scholarship towards my academic training, I can continue to dedicate my time to studying nursing and remain one step closer toward my goal of graduating in the spring of 2015. Thank you, Suny Orange, for considering me for your scholarship.

I studied Graphic Communications and learned all about the many styles and facets of printing but I also took business classes, which resulted in a Minor in Business. I was confident that I wanted to be in sales and that I was a bonafied “business woman.” I went on to work in sales in the printing industry and later took my sales experience into other industries. I liked my job and my customers but I felt like something was missing. I wasn’t happy. I wasn’t making a difference in the world around me as I desperately wanted to do. So, I prayed for guidance and continued to work knowing that the right opportunity would come along. And on December 13, 2013 I was laid off from the job I had for over 4 years.  
Being laid off was a shock. It was uncomfortable and hurtful. I was forced to ask myself “What now? Who are you now?” But what had started as a shocking disappointment had turned into an opportunity of a lifetime and a true blessing. As it turns out, I hadn’t changed much. I have always cared deeply for others and wanted to make an impact in this world and in people’s lives by showing them care and support. But there is still the question of “What now?” Getting laid off has given me the opportunity to be set free and make a change in my life. I am currently enrolled in SUNY Orange and I hope to apply and be accepting into the Nursing Program in Spring 2015. I hope to become a Registered Nurse and continue my education to become a Certified Midwife and Lactation Specialist. 
Back to the question of growth: How have I changed since my first year of college? That question has a two-part answer. The first answer would relate to my “first” Freshman year. As an eighteen year-old Freshman, I knew that college was important but I did not have the life experience to understand who I was and what I wanted for my life. Since that time I have worked, experienced and had the opportunity to live life as a grown person and understand how important it is to do what you love and follow your passion. The second part of the answer would relate to my time as a student at SUNY Orange. When I started SUNY Orange I was nervous and unsure – partly because it had been so long since I had been in a classroom but also because getting laid off has a psychological effect on your measurement of self-worth and ability. Throughout this semester I have seen that I am totally capable of studying hard, getting top -tier grades and really immersing myself in the preparation for my life as a nurse. Everything matters. Everything counts. I have found my happy again and I have reaffirmed what I always knew, even if I had moments of doubt, that I can do this and I will do this. The growth this year alone has been immeasurable and will be gift that I always cherish.

When I first signed up for college I was a quiet person and always kept to myself, but I have noticed since taking my classes that I am more vocal. When my teachers ask questions in a class I am able to answer with out hesitation, and am usually one of the first people to answer. Also my shyness has receded and I am able to assist my classmates who may be struggling and are in need of study or homework help. I have become more independent. As a student, I am able to handle more situations on my own at school and at home. My husband's job requires him to be gone away often and for long periods of time.

My bronze has been well received and my work ethic has insured that I have been invited back this semester. Last summer I was awarded the SUNY Purchase Baccalaureate and Beyond Scholarship.

These meritorious scholarships, in addition to 2 semesters on the Dean’s List with a 4.0 GPA, success in several Honors courses and active membership in Phi Theta Kappa, where I serve as Director of Recruitment, reflect my determined focus and ability to overcome the specific challenges that face non-traditional students returning to college. I recently returned from the PTK regional conference and am currently running for the office of chapter president.

While attending SUNY Purchase last summer I organized a forest cleanup with several of my classmates. At SUNY Orange I have led weekly study groups, been a note taker for a disabled student, participated in forum discussions and surveys conducted by the the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, sat on the Panel Discussion regarding SUNY Community College Exhibition issues, attended by special invitation, CIT Appy Hour where I shared my insights on technology in classroom. I volunteered to assist with installation of the 9th Annual Student Art Show and was honored to act as an Ambassador of Art for that same show’s opening reception. In addition, I have been hired by SUNY Orange as an art history tutor.","Due to an undiagnosed learning disability, traditional schooling was difficult for me and fear of repeating the failures of my youth has instilled in me a fierce drive and determination to excel in college. I was initially terrified to come back to school at this later stage of my life and being a single mom with few resources have amplified the challenges. The academic experience has been both stimulating and fascinating. Initial anxiety has given way to confidence and self-assurance. The encouragement received from professors and fellow students alike has been instrumental in my own self-reevaluation. Having a revitalized interest in art and history, and discovering an aptitude for research and design, for the first time in my life I am truly proud of my achievements.While going back to school as an adult does present unique challenges, my maturity and confidence give me clarity of purpose. As in the past, I recognize that sustained efforts will indeed lead to a great future. 

My success thus far and my extraordinary efforts have led to 2 semesters with a 4.0 GPA.  I am now serving as a wonderful role model for my learning disabled daughter who has seen my efforts pay off and is now actually doing better in school as a result. I've overcome some of the hardest challenges of my life in recent years and my year in college is a great achievement in the midst of great personal and economic losses.

Having received the support and encouragement early on from my professors gave me confidence to help myself learn by helping others. I'm thrilled to say that all the students who actively participated in my art history study groups, none received less than an A for their final grades!

My continued praise of SUNY Orange led to my son's transfer here from CUNY Queens and my youngest daughter has finally begun to express interest in attending college after attending several museum trips with faculty led groups. My entire family is already reaping the benefits of my first year at college and for this I am extremely proud and grateful.

I am a 43 year old that has been in my current field for over 26 years. I started in the dental field ,as a dental assistant, right after high school and have been working full time ever since. I grew up in Virginia and moved here after graduating high school, and worked 2-3 jobs at a time to survive. I met my future husband and was with him for almost 7 years before getting married.  I was married for over 15 years, and am now divorced since 2011. Although I am not a stranger to working hard to achieve success, and have done whatever it took to survive in this world, I knew that a degree was a necessity to a more financial secure future, and have decided to become a dental hygienist. I currently make approximately 44,000 a year. With an associate in applied science degree in dental hygiene, I can make at least 75,000 a year, and be a more independent person,and a more productive member of society. 
Enrolling in to SUNY orange has been one of the best decisions of my life. It has opened up a whole new world to me and has changed my life for the better. Because of the convenience of night classes and it being only minutes from my job and home, I have been able to finish 24 credits so far toward the pre requisite requirements of my degree. I was able to complete 6 credits a semester. The college experience as a whole has been the most rewarding experience for me, essentially giving me more self esteem and confidence that I can do anything as long as I set my mind to it. While it has been a challenge going back to school at my age, I have worked to maintain a 4.0 GPA and hope to keep it as long as I can. 
I have applied to the dental hygiene program this fall and hope to get in and start full time. If I do not get in this fall, I plan to start full time school anyway by completing some of the business administration classes. My employment status will be changing, as my boss is going to retire, and will lay me off, so I need any type of scholarship I can get to help me further myself and obtain my degrees.

","Now that one year of college is almost under my belt, I have learned a lot about myself both as a student and as a person. As a student, I have learned that in college, good grades do not get handed to you. Each individual student has to work hard and give it all that they have to offer. I am truly proud of where I have ended up and the choices that I have made in order to get to where I am today. Whether I got a C+ or an A+ in a class, I know that I have tried my absolute best and that is really all I can do. Throughout school, I have always spent a sufficient amount of time on homework and studying. College, though, has made me realize that there is not enough time in a day to study or complete homework without feeling stressed. Weekends do not necessarily mean time off anymore. A weekend in high school compared to a weekend in college is like day and night, and I am okay with that. I know that one day, all my hard work will pay off and I will get to do something that I love for the rest of my life. As a person, I have become prouder of who I am. In high school, for example, I would be one of the only students throughout my study halls that would sit and not waste any time when it came to homework. I did feel out of the “loop” and a little insecure at times, but I knew it was the right thing to do. Once I started college, I realized that most people do that now, and it is completely normal! As silly as it sounds, I noticed immediately on the first day and became excited to begin life as a college student. In college, people realize that working hard is vital, and now, if someone were to “fool around,” it is their choice and they are putting themselves in jeopardy. I have become proud to know that my work ethic has always been strong, but it has gotten that much stronger since college began. My ambition to try new things has also gotten stronger and being in college showed me that change is good. I cannot wait to see what the future holds because I know that everything that I do in college will only help me to succeed at greater things in life. ","Alberghini (Peter) Inspirational Scholarship

","Now that I have completed a year of college at SUNY Orange County Community College, I feel that I have grown as an individual and a student in many ways. I have grown to be a lot more responsible with completing classwork, homework, and also with my driving experience. I have also grown as a person to have different views on life. 

Being a commuter to college, especially in my case because I live an hour away, is difficult going to and from college. I have grown to be able to use my time wisely; planning to fit homework and studying in along with family and work. I have also gained responsibility on attending each and every class each semester. Although there are repercussions for missing a specific number of classes, I make sure that I do not miss a class; not because of the consequence, but because I know it's important for gaining the knowledge, learning and understanding better. I have come a long way since the beginning, when I first started here at SUNY Orange. 

I also have a different view on life because of my experience here. Since I was younger, I have always been told to chase my dreams and that hard work comes a long way. I never believed that until I started attending college at SUNY Orange. Being a commuter, working part-time and going to school full-time is a difficult life to fulfill. Managing my time is difficult as well. Having said that, I strive to succeed in my classes; to receive good grades for a better GPA every semester. With this, I now know that this hard work will pay off. I have tried to keep a great GPA, along with great grades and I feel that I have done excellent. It was hard, but I'm sure it will pay off. Hopefully, I will soon be accepted into the Radiology program, here at OCCC.

Personally, that is the reason why I chose to enroll into SUNY Orange. My first year in college has definitely made me grow as a person. Mainly in two aspects of my life: how I view my social life, and how I see my academic/ work lifestyle. College is a lot harder than I expected, but it has clearly allowed me to grow into a responsible adult.
	College has socially shown me how to prioritize what is truly important in my social life. I was the type of person who was always ready to go out with friends and family to have a good time. My first year in college handed me a huge reality check. As soon as all the homework assignments, essays, and tests started kicking in, I realized I could no longer just pick up and go out all night. School started taking over most of my weekdays, and the free-time I did have was being used for homework/studying. I was saying no to parties, family events, and even sleeping a full night seemed to be impossible. My friends couldn’t understand that between work and school, if I had free time I would rather spend it at home relaxing, and not out wasting all my energy. I was saying no to events I would have never missed before entering college. Surely, college was a lesson in responsibility, and growth into a more adult way of thinking. 
	Being in college, while maintaining two jobs and god grades certainly helped me grow as a person. While in college this past first year, I was working at a diner and a local Italian restaurant. I literally had no days off, and was working over 40 hours a week. Working so hard was only motivating me to give my all to school. I am the first in my entire family to attend college, and I see how hard my family works for below average pay. From my family I receive no economical help, so I have responsibilities I must tend to alone. College is going to be my ticket to a more rewarding lifestyle, where I could make a lot more money. Waitress pay is very little, which only motivated me to focus completely on keeping good grades in order to make it into the very competitive OCCC nursing program. Being in college forced me to reevaluate my life, and my priorities. Academically, I wanted to do the very best which has paid off since my GPA of 3.4 is very much above average. My ambition has grown enormously ever since I started school, which has made it possible for me to remain focused on my long-term goals. College has changed my character and way of viewing my life.
	Not only has college forced me to mature, it has made me a much more ambitious person. I learned to prioritize what is really important in my life, and focus on these things. My first year in college has allowed me to grow into a more responsible adult.

School has taught me that hard work and dedication really does pay for itself and that if you want something bad enough you can reach it with determination, no matter what age you are. I new love for learning has also given me the pleasure of helping other students, whether it be by tutoring or forming a study group. I am looking forward to further educate myself to reach higher goals within the Nursing and medical field. I am hoping my accomplishments will encourage my children to see their own potential, that if they put the effort in they can excel in life as I am finally seeing myself excel in life.",,Checked

Generally, my husband and children have always helped me with chores, but I have always managed the household. Since enrolling in SUNY Orange, I have had to learn how to delegate and allow my family to do more. Another way that I have grown as a student is by planning my days. I have started to get up at 5 AM so that I can study in a quiet house before I have to go to work. I now plan out my days  accordingly. Each day is planned out with a list of tasks that must be accomplished. As I go through my day, I mark off each task so that I don't miss anything. I feel that I have had to make several adjustments in my daily life to accomodate a busy schedule, but so far everything is working well.

How I have grown as a Student
	Being a full time student at SUNY Orange, as a pre-dental/liberal arts, it has given me the academic skills for everyday life.  The skills that I have gained in the last year have made me a well-rounded individual that is able to process information and apply it socially.  While learning, as a student, I can connect the elements of life with the material specified in the class room.  The coarse material is designed to prepare students with the information needed to be successful in the work force. 
	One of the courses that I have taken is Introduction to Sociology. Taking this course I have studied the social behavior, and social science of life.  This class has provided me with the ability to develop a body of knowledge about human social actions, social structure, and functions.  I’ve connected many research projects that investigates human behavior, and found the answers to the hard questions of why things are a certain way in the social network.  Its proven how one person can make a change in the society structure that we life, and reasons why history has become what we know today.  
	Another class that I have taken this year is high honors, short stories of Literature of the Non-European World.  This class has helped me geographically learn about certain areas of the world, and to connect the stories with what is taking place at that time of history.  Reading these short stories, you can feel what the authors are expressing emotionally, about the hardships they endured while living centuries ago. The authors provide vivid details of how the people struggled to survive, and the changes historically.  Learning about the history of our people gives me the ability to appreciate the life that I have as a student, and also as an American. 
Other classes like Introduction to Biology and Algebra, have given me the basic foundational skills that are need for life. These classes have helped me to be an active member of society and an organized person personally.  Science and mathematics isn’t just about solving problems, it’s about solving equations scientifically in life. It trains a person to solve general problems, and gives an individual disincline to think and solve problems in all areas of life. 
  There are many perspectives of education which play a significant role in the development of a person, the success and achievement of reaching full potential, and achieving a personal mission statement. Education is defined as the act or process of imparting or acquiring particular knowledge or skills, as for a profession. Education plays a significant role in the effectiveness of an individual. Education is offered in many forms. There are many forms of learning that help a person become educated. Talents and strengths play a significant role in the effectiveness of a person.  Being a student at Suny Orange fulfills all of these acquired skills for everyday life.

It has been quite a challenge but I have found my way to sort it out so far. Everyday I learn something new, a new word, phrase, idiom and so on. It is not only the English language that I have gotten the chance to learn but also the culture. 
               
                This is my second semester at SUNY Orange and growing as a student at college for me started by realizing what my real priorities are. Furthermore than realizing, I am taking control of my life. I know that my future depends a lot on how well I do on school. That is why I am dedicating a hundred percent to school. I do not have a job which means I have plenty of time. I like to get my school work done first before I can relax. 
              
               I have come to that point of my life where I know I am not a kid anymore and I need to do the right things. One does not always get the opportunity to study abroad, to go to the places you had always dreamed. Now I'm here and I am giving the best of me. I am not giving up until I fulfill the main goal of my life: becoming a successful teacher. 
                
               As far as my personal growth, I have realized I am not the same person back then when coming to study college in the United States was just a remote possibility. Now, being enrolled for 2 semesters at SUNY Orange, I can say I see the world and life in a very different way. There is a whole big world out there that needs to be discovered and helped. It is not just me and my problems, it is WE. We are all humans who have needs, need to be helped one to another. I want to be part of those who seek for the wellness and peace for our home, Earth.",,Checked

I thought the work load would be the same, I thought the professors would be the same, I thought I would be the same. I couldn't have be more father from the truth. College was extremely different from high school in so many ways. After only one year of college, I feel like I have grown tremendously as a student and as a person. The work load of college was much harder than high school. I never use to study for my quizzes and tests but after starting college, I devote an hour and more to studying the required material. The professors are much different from the teachers I had in high school. Professors don't treat their students like kids. It's the student's responsibility to get the required material and to put the effort in to learn it. I became much more appreciative of my school work and my responsibilities. As a person, I feel like I have grown so much. In high school, I used to be very meek and my self confidence was extremely low. College was such an eye opener to me and I am forever thankful that I chose to attend college. College has taught me that I have to start taking responsibility for my actions and for myself. As I met new people, I became much more confident in myself and my self worth. I am so much more happier now than I was one year ago. If compared to the person I was a year ago, we'd be two different people. I am forever grateful to college, especially SUNY Orange for helping me grow and become the woman I am today. I hope that I can continue to learn and grow as my time in college continues.  ",,Checked

To elaborate, for as long as I can remember I have never lived in one place, making it very troubling to concentrate on my school work. Let's just say school was at the bottom of my priority list. Anyway, around the year 2009 at the age of seventeen I believe, I dropped out of high school. With only one short year remaining, I could not force myself to go to school any longer. Since dropping out I have completed my GED, and then promptly registered for the 2013 Fall Semester at OCCC, in preparation for the established nursing program. College has truly opened up my eyes, school has become a major priority of mine. Now, when I come to school it's an internal competition with myself, always wanting to learn more, improve my scores and do better the next time around. College has truly become my saving grace, I owe my mentality and willingness to achieve to OCCC. Whenever I see the nursing students around campus in their uniforms it makes me want to push myself harder and do more. Nursing used to be a dream of mine, now it is a goal. Each day I know that I am one step closer which is what keeps me going. A couple of years ago I was headed nowhere with low self esteem, and no goal in life.

Weekly donation to church"," College has been such an incredible experience for me. Graduating from Newburgh Free Academy was not an easy task. From such a young age I was exposed to all of the things my parents tried to shelter me from. Drugs, sex, alcohol, gangs, and obscene amounts of violence. Every single day was a struggle to try and keep my head from sinking underwater, both academically and personally.
School was always something that I knew I was good at. I feel my high school, and my peers, did everything they could to try and take that from me. In the mornings, I had to make very sure to be extra early so I could wait outside on the lines for the medal detectors. After they open everything up in my bag and check my I.D., It's time to run to class. Between classes, you were lucky of there was enough room to squeeze through the crowds of kids standing by their lockers, with no intentions of getting to class on time. During class was usually a mess. Half of the class was in the process of dropping out, a couple were on drugs, one was sleeping, and the one person paying attention was usually giving the teacher a hard time. Learning was able to be accomplished, we were all just given more obstacles then to the average high school student.
After my first semester at SUNY Orange, I feel like there is nothing stopping me from achieving what has been my dream for years. I feel that every person attending college, and also teaching, is there for a purpose and wants to do well. Everyone on campus is extraordinarily helpful. The environment is absolutely a place where I feel comfortable. Outside of college I have grown with my personal self, which I never imagined would be possible. One major thing that I have noticed is my organization. I love to organize me work, and my planner is my new best friend. There is one more thing I would love to share about my college experience. It has taught me that being exposed to the bad things in high school, has built me up to be a stronger and more determined human being, that I am now ready to conquer the world.",,Checked

","       This is not the first time I have attended college, although it is my first year within the health profession program that I applied to. I have been accepted and have been participating in the Diagnostic Imaging Program here at SUNY Orange. I previously graduated from Mount Saint Mary College where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Business Management and Administration. 
	As the completion of my first semester in this Program comes near, I have noticed a very significant change in myself.   During my time here at SUNY Orange I have been able to excel in the pre-requisite classes needed to be accepted into the program as well as in the Program itself.  I have had the opportunity to participate in classroom, simulated and clinical environments which all have proven that this is the field that I want to make a career out of.
	Throughout this year I have put more time and energy into excelling in a highly competitive program.  I am aware that the Diagnostic Imaging Program prepares you for the workforce; therefore I have committed myself to strive for excellence. Being admitted to and working through this program I have been awarded with the best academic experience needed for my future career. 
 	As a person, I have grown this year by determining the best way to succeed.  As a student, I have grown this year by being able to pinpoint the best way to overcome the academic obstacles set before me. I have also dedicated myself to this program in the fullest extent, by leaving my employer I have been able to concentrate on the academic and clinical aspects of this program wholeheartedly.  Through the support and guidance that I have received throughout this year I am certain that I will be able to succeed in the Diagnostic Imaging Program and in the workforce once I graduate.

When I left college without completing my degree to become a New York State Trooper, I promised myself that I would one day return to college and get a degree.

It has not been easy to juggle the heavy work load of the SUNY Orange Radiologic Technology program, my family commitments, and my job, but I am giving it my all.

I excelled in math and science so I took engineering. This field just didn't click for me. I then became a police officer and it was a perfect fit. I had a wonderful and fulfilling career of community service, and I loved helping people. For my second career, I also want to help people so I decided to study the medical field, specifically radiology. I feel that this career will also be a perfect fit.
      I am now studying a field that I am very interested in. I love attending class and going to clinical. This time college is not just something I should be doing, I want to be here and have a greater respect for college and learning. I have children in college or soon entering, and I feel I am a great example of what hard work and giving it your all can achieve. They see me going to college, working, and taking care of the family, and I am hoping this makes them work hard and do thier best.

I have learned that I am a hard worker. I also have realized that I am a lot smarter then I've given myself credit for. Being someone who never did well in school it is exciting to see the grades I can achieve with hard work. My GPA definitely shows how motivated I am to achieve my goal.

","Since I have begun college, I have grown as a student and a person in many ways. To begin with, I'm 37 years old, so it was a rough start for me. I had not been to school in a very long time so the styles of learning and teaching were completely different from what I had been used to and very unfamiliar to me. I had to learn how to adapt and adjust. Although it was hard, I have always given 100% to my studies. I have never given up, and I never will give up. I have always maintained good grades. I have been on the Dean's list for 2 of my 4 semesters and I have always maintained a good GPA. I have become a multi-tasker in juggling school, work, my children, my husband, and just my life overall. I have learned to do my homework, make dinner and help my girls with their homework all at the same time, and it somehow works. I have gained self-confidence, something I previously lacked. I've sacrificed so much and I have worked so hard to get to where I am today, and I still am amazed with myself. I used to work for the state, but could not work there and be successful in the nursing program simultaneously. So I made a huge life altering decision by leaving there, with plans to return once I have my degree. The worst part is that I no longer have the insurance, so I need to pay out of pocket for health coverage, as my husband’s employer does not offer any affordable plan. It is very hard for us financially. Despite the hardships, I believe I am exactly where I should be at this moment in my life. Although it is a huge sacrifice and adjustment for all of us, there is nothing else that I could do to set such an incredible example for them.

","    Prior to my previous academic year at SUNY Orange, I was not as organized and focused on my career as I am today. Before attending college level classes, I did not need to be heavily versed in time allocation and put little emphasis on the importance of studying and reading outside of the classroom setting. I find that keeping myself organized with notes, handouts and study guide creation have greatly improved my academic standing. I also realized that I could not rely solely on what I learn in class, but I also needed to take my learning beyond it and learn on my own as well. Through this mindset, I have brought myself to have a sincere love for learning. I do not feel as though I have time in life to learn as much as I would like to. I realized that through my organization in school, I could also more easily manage and place importance on certain events in my personal life. In the past, I had not known what I had a passion for, as I never thought I needed to focus on it at the present point in my life. I began to think into my future more critically since entering college. I knew that I would like to enter the medical field, but not precisely which part I could see myself excelling in. I now know exactly the direction I would like to take my future career in Nursing and how I will have to manage time in order to achieve my goal.

During the day I attend classes for a degree in Nursing. Although sometimes a struggle, I make the best of it and work hard towards being successful. ","I have been enrolled at SUNY Orange since the summer of 2011. As I look back I remember the moments that made me decide that I needed to go to college and earn a degree in nursing. At work, I held the hands of many people that were nearing the end of their lives. In those moments I realized that there is so much more that I could do for these patients. I made a decision to enroll at SUNY Orange to make my dreams possible. Since my enrollment I have gained an extreme amount of knowledge and wisdom that has made me mature not only as a student but also as a person.

For the last two years I had been working full time and attending school part time. This was very difficult and certainly a struggle on most days. However, I remember waking up in the morning and reminding myself to never lose sight of my dreams. I went to class and pushed myself to do the best that I can. As a student, I learned how to balance all the different aspects of my life and still get grades that made me so proud. I learned so much about the science of my degree and they remain permanent lessons that will make me the best at what I do. 

In the time I spent at SUNY Orange I have grown so much as a person. I've learned to be humble and to never take things for granted. I remember applying to the nursing program for the first time. A few weeks later I received a letter that I was not accepted, I remember the instant devastation. I thought to myself ""I have to wait a whole year before I can apply again"". Well, I was upset about that for a few days until I realized that there are so many people that aren't fortunate enough to even attend college because they lack resources. I became very humble and started to work harder than I ever did. I applied again and got accepted. The day that letter came in the mail was the best day of my life. The light at the end of the tunnel was near and I was so much closer to my dreams. 

I am so thankful to be attending such a great school and I am proud of the person I have become. These valuable lessons will forever be instilled in me.

In OCCC, it is a very good community college, we got good professor who taught us well with knowledge. I love to been in class and share my own opinion with my classmates and teacher. In China, almost students are shy and they don't like to share their opinions, because they are too concerned about if they answer is wrong and others will laughing at them. In OCCC, from this study environment, i learned something callled communication. when the professor give us a topic, everybody will join into the conversation and talk about individually thinking. The classes are more actively than in China. Also, college are much more different than high school. In college, each student have their own dream, they know what they want to be in the future. They have a positive heart for study, because they clearly know the study is for their own future. however, in High School, we are pushing to study by our parents, because we never think about what we want to be and what we need to learn for that goal.

I am a follower of Jesus Christ and try my best to live my life according to His will. My passion in life is to love people and care for them. I am pursuing a career in Nursing to be able to do that. I'm hoping to be accepted into the Spring 2015 Nursing Program. After gaining lots of experience as a registered nurse I would like to return to school for Nurse Practitioner.  ","I started my SUNY Orange education in the summer of 2013. During the summer I took two classes and I'm currently enrolled in 3 classes for this semester. For the first time I can actually say that I  have a good GPA and I am working very hard to get the best grades that I can get for each class. When I graduated high school I immediately enrolled myself in Bronx Community College. I had just had my son and I also started a full-time job. Unfortunately I was less interested in attending class and getting good grades and more interested in making money from my job. I put little effort into studying and attending class. I also had a very low GPA. When I finally decided it was time for me to return to school I wanted to make sure that I was not going to make the same mistakes I did before.  I wanted to be an excellent student and get excellent grades. I registered for the placement test at SUNY Orange several times I continued to reschedule the test for months because I wanted to study as much as I can for the placement test so that I can get a high score and not have to take remedial classes to avoid spending time and money that I do not have. Going back to college after years and on top of that attending summer courses which give a full semester of information in just a few weeks was a bit difficult. But I studied, worked hard and attended the classes and I ended up getting an A and B+ in the courses. I plan on doing the same thing for this semester. For the short time that I have been attending SUNY Orange it has changed my perspective on a lot of things. I now take school seriously as oppose to before. I am faced with many responsibilities in my work and family life but school has helped me to become more responsible.  My GPA is an exact reflection of my dedication and my responsibilities in school. And that is why I have grown as a student to take school very seriously and  it's extremely important that I not only feel that it's necessary to get good grades but it is something that I enjoy doing and that I am proud of. Just alone with my GPA I see how much that I have grown. Before I was satisfied with just receiving the minimum passing grade. But now I work hard for A's and hope to move my GPA up to a 4.0. As a person I've grown and decided that I was not going to make any more excuses for why I wasn't going to attend college. Being a wife, a mother, a worker and a student is never easy but it is possible. And I hope that I can be an example to other young parents who have maybe had the same path that I did  from not caring to do well in school to really wanting to be an excellent student. I am grateful to SUNY Orange for giving me an opportunity to pursue my nursing dreams. ",,Checked

In June of 2013, after receiving help from the town of walkill police, and getting an animal rescue on board and Hudson Valley ASPCA, i was able to get 2 pit bulls who were being abused rescued from a lot off of Goshen Tpke. Since Fall of 2013 I have been volunteering for the Walden Humane Society. I was fostering a feral kitten to socialize her so she could become adoptable, until I myself adopted her in December 2013. I also volunteer at the shelter and at Petsmart where they have cats for adoption. ","          For as long as I can remember I never seemed to fit in with other kids. I couldn't socialize like them, couldn't concentrate like them and just always had my own way of doing things. Then at 14 years old, I found out that I was suffering from a mental illness. I was affected through out high school but I was determined to change college. I enrolled in my first semester at OCCC in the fall of 2008 and did very well my first semester. The next three semesters didn't go as planned. My mental illness caused a lack of motivation to do my schoolwork. Some days I couldn’t even get out of bed. In the spring of 2010 I left mid-semester after being hospitalized for mental health issues. Upon discharge from the hospital, I went into a residential facility to learn how to live with my mental illness. I took time off from school to work on improving myself. In December of 2011, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I returned to college in the spring of 2012, but this time I knew how to live with my mental illness. I was on medicine for my ADHD, in addition proper accommodations helped me with my learning disability. 
          Since I’ve returned to college as a more stable, mature adult, I have received all high marks. I want to be in school and I understand the hard work it is going to take. I've realized that trying hard means dedicating myself to school by doing the homework, doing the assigned reading and studying for exams and quizzes. Now that I'm enjoying school and living a healthy life, I’ve realized that fighting the stigma on mental illness and advocating for others like me is what I want to do with my life. I switched my major to Human Services and am now planning on becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. I want to help those like myself when I was younger, who struggle to live healthy lives and how that affects their performance in school.

In high school I was just average, now I’m very proud of myself and my grades. In high school I was decent with my grades, now I’m motivated more than ever to get 3.0’s.  I’ve also found that within my second year I’m not afraid to ask for help. This year I went and found myself a tutor the first day of class so if I didn’t understand something, my tutor could help me. I’ve understood that my time here at school is going to determine my future and I believe that is what makes me so determined to do well.
 
As a person I think I have grown a lot. I think I’ve became more motivated and independent. Like I said before I’m very motivated now than I was in high school. I’m driven to work hard outside of school and still get exceptional grades.  I’ve also found a better way to manage my time. I try to set aside certain times to complete my school work and still have time for myself. I think I’ve become more independent throughout college. I find myself not relying on others as much.

Sometimes just giving a word of encouragement to one of my classmates can help them out. I always try to be a positive force in all that I do.
Being a student has also helped me with my children. When I was in high school I did not have much time to study and apply myself because I worked full-time. I had to help out my family in any way I could as money was tight. My biggest regret in life was dropping out my senior year so that I could pick up extra work. I have always been a bit embarrassed to admit that to my children. I have always valued education but I had hard decisions to be made at the time. I am very proud now to pursue my college degree. I work more effectively with my children and their study habits in school as well. I am encouraging them to continue on and seek out their degrees after high school.

Earning all A's in this first year made me more confident and increased my time management skills. The following year I decided to register for full time classes and keep full time status at my place of business. After completing that year with all A's, I decided it was time to see what I could really do at college. So, the following fall I registered for Calculus, General Biology 1, and General Chemistry 2. This course load was more than I was used to, but being that I received an A in General Chemistry 1 and math was my favorite subject, I assumed that I would still do well in these respective courses. Biology, on the other hand, was not something I was looking forward to, as I did not do well in this area during high school. However after completing half of this fall semester, I found that I not only did well in this subject, I enjoyed it. This is ultimately when I started thinking about a dual major and spoke with my academic adviser. My time at this institution has been so enjoyable and I have learned so much about myself, I almost hate to leave for graduate school in 2015. Ultimately, I have learned that anything you really want to do in life, you can, if you're really willing to apply yourself. ",,Checked

I honestly believed that it was too late for me to take on the role of student, but not only have I done so, I have embraced it. In calendar year 2013 alone, I completed 31 credit hours and maintained a 4.0 grade point average while taking on some extremely difficult material. This number alone does not reflect all that it should, however. During this time, I learned to prioritize my academic career and only missed one class. This was accomplished while managing the responsibilities I have to my family, our military community, and other students.  Although I was not an official peer tutor, I helped my fellow students by encouraging their academic growth as well. This sometimes was reflected by merely an acknowledgement of a job well done, recommendations on how they could get better results, and all the way to group study sessions. My goal is to help others in all that I do, and that has been reflected during my first year of college in my interactions with my peers and my chosen major of nursing.

WORK - 2012 - present: Tractor Supply Co, Pine Bush NY","Since I began my college career, I feel I have grown tremendously, both as a person and a student. Upon graduating high school, I was a very shy, soft-spoken person who was hesitant to take risks and try new things. Now, just a few short years later, I am more apt to take a lead role and offer advice. In addition, I am more willing to try new and unfamiliar things. SUNY Orange has also helped me to grow as a student, teaching me better organization and time management skills, so I am able to balance school with working two jobs and family time. I have met numerous people throughout my college career, both teachers and students, who have had a great impact on my education and life, and I will never forget them or the gifts they have given to me, by taking their time to help me, offer me advice, or encourage me to come out of my shell and get involved.  I have joined multiple clubs and through them, have gained many new friends. Three years ago, as a high school senior, I never would have imagined being where I am today, in a position where I will volunteer to do something and always offer a helping hand, instead of being worried about something going wrong or someone not liking me because of something I have done. I have learned in the past three years, that what people think of you today is not going to matter tomorrow, as long as you are striving to do your best and make tomorrow better than today, then it is all worthwhile. I wish my high school career was much like that of college and I could have grown into the new me years ago!","ALBERGHINI (PETER) INSPIRATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP

This essay finds me in a much different place.  Every class I have completed successfully and put behind me has boosted my confidence, expanded my knowledge base, honed my study skills, and made me feel a part of the SUNY Orange community.  After finishing these classes and meeting requirements I was accepted into the nursing program.  Beginning this part of my college career, my mindset is nothing like when I first walked into my General Psychology class one and a half years ago.  I was a nervous and unsure outsider who didn't know if I had what it took to make college work for me.  When I enter my first nursing class on January 23, I will hold my head high, ready and prepared to jump right in.  
    
     My life outside of class is so much richer than I ever thought it would be when I began this journey.  I usually tend to keep away from on-campus socializing, work outside of class, and getting involved in college activities.  This student who one and a half years ago felt uncomfortable and unsure is now taking the time to tutor students in the Learning Center frequently.  I've seen these students excel in their subjects, and formed wonderful friendships in the process.  Support from other students is not something I sought out, and now I feel like I couldn't live without it.  I am most proud of my efforts to bring mental health awareness and suicide prevention to SUNY and our local community.  With the assistance of Professor Christine Henderson and the Wellness Center, I initiated and organized multiple events bringing education and awareness to the students and staff.  Having lost my father to suicide 6 years ago, I brought my own experience, and was pleased to be a speaker at the most recent event.  This advocacy has helped me in my personal journey, but most importantly has helped enlighten the SUNY community. Planning for the next event has already begun.         
    
     I am not the same person that drove into the campus garage three semesters ago and sat with hands shaking and heart beating out of my chest before I could head up to my class.  SUNY Orange has made me a confident, capable, leader and I am ready for my next challenge!","- Last year I was blessed to receive the Paul and Ida Lipschutz Scholarship, which meant so much to me not only for the substantial financial help it gave me, but also because I fondly remember Dr. and Mrs. Lipschutz when visiting their office as a child.  I would be honored if they would consider me for this award again.
-  It would be an honor to receive one of the nursing delegated scholarships, since being accepted to the Nursing program at SUNY Orange means so much to me.

I realized that I wanted to be in the medical field, so I decided that I will become a registered nurse. Now that I have a career path that I truly wish to be in, I can excel in my classes even more because I'm more determined than ever. Now going into my second year of college I have grown into a more responsible student. A student who puts more effort into his effort more than ever. In some ways I am thankful for my first year of college because I found a new light, one that I wish to pursue with all might. My Goal here at Suny Orange is to be accepted into the nursing program. I know that road before is a difficult one, but I know for a fact that if work hard, it will all pay of for me. It's simply a matter of waiting. Lastly, My first year at Suny Orange made a more organized person. I am no longer a procrastinator. I plan my class schedule months in advance, before a semester begins I read the text books, so that I have some prior knowledge and understanding of the material.

I used to skip class, not study, procrastinate on the homework, and drop or withdrawal from classes every semester for about the first two years. The worst of it all, I was wasting both of my and my mother's money we paid for school. At the time, I never cared. Maybe I was coming out of high school, excited that I get to be on my own, no strict rules like in high school. It didn't dawn on me until I was twenty or twenty-one years old when I saw many of my high school classmates in their senior year in college and here I was still in my first year in college. I am twenty-three, so it took me about two years to realize that I have to get my life together. Looking over this past semester, I have grown to appreciate time, time to study. I have also realized for the first time in my life, school is what I need in order to succeed in life.
	The second year of college, I worked full time and found myself always feeling stressed because I never had time to study and if I did have the time, I would be tired from work and I did not focus as much as should have. I remember when my last class would be over, I would be the first one running through the door just so I can get to work on time. I was always on the go and my mind never had time to unwind. I used to have many long nights of studying which was never good because I rarely got sleep which caused me to do bad on exams because my brain did not have time to absorb all that information in. So, in order to have time to study, I no longer work full time. Since working part time, I have done much better in school.
	After the last semester, I learned that in order to succeed in school, I have to review and study all the work learned in class. For the first time in a very long time, I enjoy learning and studying because I love the outcome of getting A's. I plan a definite time to review or study each day which I never did in the past. Everything I learned in class for the day, I would go through the notes afterwards. I noticed that it is good to study a little every day so I won't be cramming for hours the night before an exam. 
	I always look back to when I first started college and wish I can get it back because all the time and money I wasted. All I do is spend my free time studying, doing homework and I only work part time now. I never liked school as much as I like it now because as I am getting older, I am always thinking about what I am going to do with my life and if I want to be successful, I have to do well in school. Now, I am getting A's in my classes because I have more of a mature mind. I am not saying college is stress free but I always remember to think positive and do my best because all the hard work will be worth it in the end. Although it took me a few years to get my school life together, I always think, ""Better late than never.""","Any scholarship would be greatly appreciated!",Checked

I have grown immensely as a person throughout my college career. I have matured and gained a wealth of knowledge that I try to pass along to my students through my current job at a local school district in Orange County. I also feel I have gained a lot of life experience, both good and bad, which has made me a well rounded human being that contributes to our economy. 

I am looking forward to gaining more knowledge as I move forward into being accepted into the Nursing program at SUNY Orange. I believe a career in nursing can be so valuable to you and others. It gives you the opportunity to learn about someone, share experiences and techniques, as well as show compassion and empathy, which I feel in today's world lacks. 

In the future, I would like to eventually combine my two degrees, and becoming a school nursing or even teaching nursing. Then I would be able to pass along my love for teaching as well as nursing to students of all ages. 

All in all, I have found my time in actual placements to have more lasting effect and provide more experience for myself. Being hands-on and working with people whether it is a placement or a lab setting has given vital opportunities for growth and to learn all facets of a human being. ",,Checked

I remember starting college, I was young and not dedicated at all. I worked a dead end job with no real responsibilities up to that date and thought I was above it all. Starting college was an eye opener and in a way, traumatic experience. High School had not prepared me at all for the real world. I started the semester with a full course load, eventually dropping down to 1 or 2 classes and in the semester that followed I did the same. By the Third semester I had dropped completely, overcome by my laziness and immature ways, only this time, I had wasted a considerable amount of my parents money. For the next two years I would work at a minimum wage job, with no hope for a raise and no room for advancement, thinking I knew it all and too complacent to care. As the economy got worse, so did my fate. I lost my comfortable dead end job in March 2013, at 21 years old, without not even 2 hours warning, or enough money to pay my bills. I was broke with no education, and no hope for a future. It was then that I decided I wanted to be my own boss, go back to school, and take control of my own future. In the almost 6 months of unemployment that followed I took action. I found a better job then I could have ever dreamed of and reapplied to college, determined to stick it out. In the fall semester of 2013, my first semester back, I managed 2 ""A's"" and 2 ""B's"" while working my new job. It was undoubtadly the best feeling of accomplishment I had ever had. It's  no secret that the last 4 years of my life have been nothing to write about, but above all its been a learning experience. In the last 4 years I have grown to learn that life doesn't sugar coat things and it waits for no one. To get ahead in this world you need to make something yourself, take responsibility and stop relying on others to do it for you, you are always better then what you settle for.

College teaches you what it’s like to be in real life. I have finished two years of college. I can’t imagine not being in school and learning. I have grown as a person so much from my first day of college to now.  I was never the best student growing up; I didn’t apply myself to my work. In college, for my first semester I thought I could do as I did in high school. I would go to class without studying, fail my tests and go home and not do my homework. After my first semester, I realized that I actually enjoyed what I was learning and I started to do really well. I realized I wanted to be a nurse and that it wasn’t going to be easy to get into one of the toughest nursing programs I’ve heard of. I pushed myself, I made myself stronger and I actually wanted to go to class to learn. I constantly say “I wish I tried this hard in high school, I would have been valedictorian.” I have two brothers and I have convinced my little brother to take college level courses in high school and next year he will be entering college with 30 credits before even graduating.  I realize college isn’t for everyone, but college is for me. It makes me feel good to come home from school and brag about my good grades rather than waiting to be grounded for doing poorly. It feels good to see my name in the paper for getting a perfect 4.0 for my first time ever. It feels even better to get accepted into a tough nursing program on my first application. I heard people have been waiting for years to be accepted, and I got accepted first try. Last, it feels better than anything in the world to be able to be in a program that I love.  College has taught me what real life is. You have to work for what you want, nothing comes easy. College has taught me that I’m not studying to pass tests; I’m studying to start my life. ",,Checked

Work full time while managing school and living expenses 
Part time work at Bear Mountain Inn, and Newburgh Muay Thai ","Upon completion of my first year at SUNY Orange, I have significantly grown and excelled academically and personally. My initial goal was to invest in my future, but this year I have learned the true meaning of leadership and perseverance. I have had to face and overcome several obstacles throughout the course of this year that were devastating both emotionally and financially. I have learned to adapt to new situations while maintaining the determination to not give up. The new experiences and hardships I have endured this year has been humbling, yet motivating for me. 
I was initially thrilled to begin my journey in the COTA program this in the fall of 2013. I work full time as well as work two part time jobs on the weekend. I had prepared myself finically, and made sacrifices in order to afford tuition for the COTA program, with no financial assistance from my family, or student loans. I am not eligible for financial assistance because I have earned a four year degree prior to enrolling in SUNY Orange. Unfortunately before the fall semester of 2013 began, my apartment was broken in to, and the majority of my belongings, and savings were taken from me. However, I persevered and managed to save all that I could in the short amount of time I had. Although this was a devastating experience for me, reflecting on it now has made me realize that sometimes things are out of my control, and I made the best of the situation. I had to look at the bigger picture and work twice as hard to support myself, afford school, and live independently. I didn’t let the financial set back have any negative influence on my academic performance, and managed to maintain a GPA above 3.5, while I participated in extracurricular activities, and completed level I fieldwork, and participating as class treasurer for the COTA Club. The exceptional faculty leading the COTA program have nurtured and inspired my academic experience by keeping me engaged in program activities, while teaching me how to strive as a professional out in the field. The community involvement through the COTA program has also shown me that me that volunteering and through giving, I have received more. The course curriculum and problem based learning which is the core of the COTA program, has  also had a positive influence on me, teaching me to adapt and learn methods to not only weather the storm, but to come out a stronger, more resourceful, and inspired person. I remained engaged and committed to learning this year despite my hardships. Personal growth has come through the form of struggle for me this year, but it has certainly been humbling. 
This experience has made me grow as a person because I’ve learned that there will always be unpredictable variables, but it’s up to the individual to persevere despite the adversity.  The challenges I’ve had to face have prepared me for the future while giving me a feel for how to perform to the best of my ability, under less then perfect conditions. I am certain that my academic and professional goals will be achieved, no matter what the circumstances are. I understand that a scholarship is an investment in the future. This investment in my future will enable me to spend more time engaging in leadership activities, community based activities, as well as increase my involvement on the SUNY Orange campus.

I would answer phones, start the process for heming pants, and I would help her organize her closet. By doing this, I was working every day of the week and going to college as a full time student. ","As someone who has completed one year of college, I have grown greatly as a student and as a person. As a student, there are many challenges such as getting good grades. Getting a good grade in a class requires a lot of studying and time. Completing one year of college helped me realize that developing good study techniques is important, and by studying more my second year of college, my GPA was raised. By studying every night, I grew as a person as well. Studying every night taught me time management and what my responsiblites as a student were.
Another challenge as a student is working while attending college.  It is hard to maintain a decent GPA while working twenty five hours to thirty hours a week. However, this forced me to learn how to break down big assignments and to break them up into parts I could work on everyday. This also helped me grow as a person because breaking down a major project into smaller parts is a skill that can be used in any situation. 
Since I have completed one year of college, I learned good study habits, which will help me as I move on in my college carrer, I learned time management which is a skill that is needed for everyone. I also learned to take apart bigger projects and make them into more managable projects. These skills helped me grow as a student and as a person in order to do my best. ","Bartlett, JR. (George R.
