My time here has enlarged my viewpoint and deepened my enthusiasm for learning. That love of learning will illuminate the rest of my college and professional career in the art of filmmaking.

I have been inspired by many professors and courses that I have taken at SUNY Orange. I never liked foreign language courses before, but my experiences with Professors Wright and Rivière have inspired me to learn French better than I ever thought I could. The enthusiasm they engendered led me to attend SUNY Model European Union in Brussels, Belgium, over winter break, where I tested the limits of my new found enthusiasm for the French language. This experience has created an ambition to study abroad for a semester in France, something I never even considered doing before attending SUNY Orange. Knowing the impact that two weeks in Brussels has had, I look forward to the life altering experience of a semester abroad.

My extracurricular experiences at SUNY Orange have provided me with a practical application for the skills and information I learned in class. Serving on Student Senate, being the chair of its Rules Committee; being the student representative on the Academic Policy Committee and being  the SUNY Orange delegate to the SUNY Student Assembly has given me a greater appreciation for the skills I learned in courses such as Foundations of Communication and has taught me an enormous amount about group dynamics. In starting and running the Debate Club, I have been able not only to create a successful enterprise, but also provide a forum for students to work through and seriously discuss many of the issues they learn of in their classes. These experiences will serve me in good stead while navigating the collaborative and often entrepreneurial work inherent in filmmaking. 

SUNY Orange has given me an amazing college experience that has deepened my love of and enthusiasm for learning, which I believe is the greatest thing an education can do for an individual. No matter where I go from here, I will always be grateful to SUNY Orange for providing me that experience.","DOUGHERTY (TRUSTEE EDWARD P.) SCHOLARSHIP

Volunteer at Middletown Elks Club Pancake Breakfast 11/03/13","As an accredited community college with great professors that truly hold their students to the highest standards, SUNY Orange has been a great school to attend.  One of the greatest things I have learned would be to do things right the first time with full effort. Hard work pays off and once the hard work is done you can enjoy relax and without the worry of falling short on the work you have produced. Full effort corresponds to the amount of confidence you have in your work. When you invest time into an assignment or studying for test you have a level of certainty that you have done your best. In that level of certainty there is little room for self-doubt and that question of “could I have done better”. While at SUNY Orange I have been able to iron out the wrinkles of my first two years of college and mentally focus on my degree. I will admit my first two semester of college were the most difficult. I had very bad time management and I was not pushing myself to my full potential. Fall 2013 was my best semester thus far. I cannot tell you the amount of joy that overwhelmed me when I saw my GPA of a 3.45 for the first time. I knew what I was capable of. Unfortunately I wish I could have worked as hard from the beginning. But there is no use in crying over spilt milk, I can only learn from my mistakes and move forward. When majoring in a business degree or any degree for that matter it is important that work is done accurately and to full potential. In relationship to real world internships and careers half-assed jobs are the equivalent to failure.

First and foremost, it has taught me to keep my options open and to never settle for just one thing.  My dream has always been to become a crime scene investigator.  That was the only job I wanted.  I turned my eye away from anything else.  However, in my last couple of semesters at OCCC, especially with Mr. Zuesetek, I have learned to keep my doors open to almost anything in my field.  You cannot just graduate from college and automatically become an investigator.  First, you must become a police officer and work your way up.  In today's society the competition is extremely high and you may never get the career you have always dreamed of.  As a result, I have taken the corrections exam, unarmed security guard courses, and very soon I will be taking the NYPD exam.  SUNY Orange has also taught me better time management skills.  In high school as long as your work was completed and handed in, there was never really a penalty if you handed in your assignment a day or two late.  At SUNY Orange it is almost the complete opposite.  If you do not hand your assignment in on time, you pay the price.  At first, I thought teachers were harsh for giving me an automatic zero, but then I learned the lesson behind it.  In real life nothing stops for you.  We cannot stop the clock.  Everyday we are faced with obstacles, but we still need to handle our responsibilities.  Criminal Justice has always been my passion since ninth grade and I am determined to do whatever it takes to one day be employed in this field.",,Checked

Since I was in highschool, I've always known that I wanted to help people for a living. I loved being able to give people advice and help them in any way I could. SUNY Orange has prepared me by taking classes such as Pscyhology to be able to understand the human mind. It has also given me thoughts and ideas of how to help people. All the courses I have taken have made me a well rounded student and I feel educated not just in Criminal Justice or math but, also in all other subjects. Suny Orange helped me by pushing me to achieve my future goals of attending John Jay. Not only the teachers would push me to better myself but, the students and tutors as well. The clubs at Suny Orange have also helped me. They have encouraged me to get involved in the community. I have also made many friends and know many teachers. Suny Orange has helped me become determined, motivated, and to stop procrastinating. In highschool, I did not work hard at all to get the grades I wanted. At Suny Orange, I had to work extremely hard to get the grades I want. Suny Orange has changed something within myself. I love being apart of the clubs and I am comfortable with my teachers.  I use to be scared to raise my hand and now I just want to shout out the answers in class. Suny Orange made me smart and helped me encourage others to reach thier goals and never give up. It has helped me work and try harder in life and everything I do. Although my life may be hectic, I love everything I do. Suny Orange has given me the knowledge I need to be able to achieve my dreams.

","My education at SUNY Orange has had a profound effect on my future. The decision to attend SUNY Orange has helped me to mature as a college student as well as become acclimated to the college work load. The small class sizes and various support services offered at SUNY Orange have allowed me to be successful and explore my full potential. These small class sizes have also given me the opportunity to receive one-on-one help from my professors to overcome challenges and be the best I can be. 
My journey throughout college has been a lot of work but I have learned to adapt to my courses and do well at SUNY Orange. This skill will help to prepare me for my future studies, and to manage the demands of the ever-changing field of engineering. Several times during my education at SUNY Orange, I had the opportunity to listen to alumni guest speakers. They talked about how well the SUNY Orange curriculum had prepared them for their future studies and ultimately success in their careers. This success is due largely in part to the rigors of academics at SUNY Orange. This rigor will allow me to smoothly transition to and to even excel in a 4 year institution. Additionally, the broadness of the engineering curriculum has prepared me for any branch of engineering I choose to pursue by giving me many options to choose from. 
SUNY Orange has not only prepared me academically, but has also provided me with many opportunities to work with others on a team. Being a member of the engineering club, I worked with other students on collaborative projects such as the electric car and the tesla coil. These projects have given me the opportunity to enhance my team work and leadership skills. This semester I am happy to lead the tesla coil project. This position has given me invaluable experience in design and oversight of a project. This experience will open doors to my future and put me ahead of students at other colleges that have not had such opportunities. 
Overall, my education at SUNY Orange has had a great impact on preparing me for the future. It has allowed me to grow as a person and as a leader. It has also taught me the skills necessary to become a successful student and a well-rounded individual. These characteristics will help me succeed in the future, and attain my professional goal of becoming a civil engineer.

If I had not gone here, my resume and self-esteem would be subpar.  My education at SUNY Orange has prepared me for the future by helping me realize my potential.
When I first came to SUNY Orange, I was 17, fresh out of high school and nervous about what lie ahead of me. I had wanted to continue being a farmer so I went into Management. In my Intro to Business course, I met my instructor Mr. Urmston. He is invaluable to me. Without him, I would have never decided to change my major, pursue my dreams and go to a four year college. 
Mr. Urmston also pushed me to better myself by joining the Business Club. Here, I learned that what you learn in class is nowhere near as challenging as the real life application. I assisted in marketing for the club’s bake sales. I found out that marketing is more than just some pretty colors and a few bold words. Sometimes, a smile will make all the difference.  It takes a lot of commitment to bring people together. 
The most difficult thing I learned was how to manage people. In classes, I learned how to bring ideas out of people and help them to feel involved, but this semester in the shirt committee was the most challenging thing of all. I had a committee of approximately 10 people for what needed about two. I had to manage the flow of ideas through the group and get decisions made within a timely manner. I was able to put to work all of the skills I’d acquired from Human Resource Management. It was really exciting for me to be able to take things outside the classroom. 
The most prominent memory is when I was working at H&R Block and taking Principles of Management at the same time. I had already been working for some time when, in class, we discussed how to answer the phone for a business. I was surprised to learn that smiling when you answer the phone makes you sound friendlier. I applied that to answering the phones at H&R Block and noticed that the amount of appointments I made increased dramatically. 
I can’t believe that two years ago, I thought that I would be just another farmer like everyone else I know. The people I met and experiences I had at SUNY Orange guided me to pursue my dreams. I now know that I can be anything and do anything that I want to achieve.  I am very happy with what I’ve learned at SUNY Orange and I’m thrilled to say that I can take that to a four year college. I have put in a lot of hard work through the last two years and I know that I’ll be able to reach my goals, and it is all due to the education that I received during my time at SUNY Orange.

I am the treasurer for the Architecture Club at SUNY Orange. I have been the treasurer for this club for three out of the four semesters I've attended the school. (Started January 2013 - Present)
I collaboratively am working with three other students and one of my professors on designing and building and exhibition space that will display the work of the Architecture department in Orange Hall. The aim of this exhibition space is to advertise the work of the department and students to family members, faculty, and other students. We have been working on it from September, 2013 - present and aim to have it open for two months in the spring. ","	I personally gained a lot from my educational experience at SUNY Orange. One of my biggest worries going into the Architecture field was the lack of available jobs for Architects because of the recession. I was constantly being told that it was a useless degree because nobody has the money to build in this economy. Within one year of my enrollment at SUNY Orange, I was able to get a drafting position at an engineering firm based solely on the skills I acquired from the school. The Architecture department offers something in the first two years that many four year schools don’t offer at all; a class dedicated to teaching us how to draft in an office. Working Drawings I & II really helped me fall into the fast pace of office drafting and made it much easier to adjust to basic drafting standards.
	And that's just what I gained from one class. The experience as a whole was something very unique and special. The Architecture department is small, with three main professors, so it is very nice to build up good relationship with those teaching me. Seeing the same professors often for multiple classes each day, five days a week really creates an eagerness to learn because I have built a friendship and respect with those I am learning from. They know  how to explain new concepts so that the students will understand because they know the students well enough to see what works best for them. There's something about the whole dynamic that is very sweet and I am honestly going to miss it when I transfer to a bigger four year school. 
	Students don’t just build relationships with the professors; it goes for the other students as well. I am one in a class of about twelve, and we all have the same schedule, so we spent all day together Monday through Friday. The friendships you build are really special because they are with people who have similar aspirations as you do and you can help each other achieve them. My class works together very well. Before a big test, we always have a final review as group so that we all can understand the material. We will go out of our way to help one another on a project even when we don’t have time. We bring in cupcakes to celebrate each others' birthdays.  We all cleaned the architecture lounge and made it look nicer so we have a place to go and do homework together when the classrooms are full. We have built up an extremely strong sense of community within our department and it makes the overall educational experience really fun, taking away some of the academic stress that is always lingering.
	The last big factor that has made my experience at O.C.C.C. so wonderful is my participation in school activities. I have been the treasurer of the Architecture Club for three out the four semesters that I've attended the school. It is a lot of work. I financially plan each trip and club activity that takes place each semester as well as hold meetings with the other club officers. I’ve attended numerous leadership events and student events. I've held bake sales and stayed late for food giveaways. I choose to sign up every semester and take on all that work on top f my academic course load because I really feel I learn a lot from it. I've learned leadership skills; I know how to hold a meeting and motivate other people to get involved. I've learned financial skills; I can create a club budget that accounts for everything the club does in the entire semester. Most people my age don't have financial skills like that. What I've learned that I think is more important than both of these is management skills. I can manage my time well enough to do all of this plus hold a steady job within my field and maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA even with a 19 credit course load for one semester. These skills will help me wherever I go.
	I am really going to miss attending O.C.C.C. After I graduate. It is a great school and it has helped me s much over the past two years. The professors, the students, and the Architecture Club really made me feel like I was a part of a community  and that’s what I’ll remember most about my experience here.","LARGE (GEORGE F.)

","My educational experience at SUNY Orange has been quite different than what I expected it to be.  I believed that I would simply go to class and go home.  However, the excellent professors, and my peers, and learning to be more responsible have made attending this school one of the most positive experiences of my life.
	The professors at SUNY Orange go above and beyond simply teaching their students.  They have given me an incredible amount of knowledge to build my future upon.  Countless times my professors have offered extra help for one-on-one teaching outside of their office hours.  This willingness to help has not only impressed me, but also inspired me to do the same for others.  What was once time set aside studying by myself has quickly been replaced by time spent with peers helping them study.  My professors have also taught me how to communicate with other students.  I no longer go to class with the mentality to get through class and go home.  Instead, I strive to meet my peers and through interaction with them, benefit my time spent at SUNY Orange.  I believe that I can learn just as much from my peers as I can from the professors.  Through group studies, I can listen to other students and consider their views on certain topics, views that I may have never seen before.  Each of these opportunities can be accredited to the excellent examples that have been displayed through professors at SUNY Orange.
	My time spent at SUNY Orange has also taught me responsibility and the important task of time management.  The biggest shock of moving out of high school to college for me was making my own schedule.  The amount of independence I found came from no longer having a guidance counselor to plan my day.  I went from having a class schedule handed to me to carefully making a schedule that fit around work and other activities perfectly.  Therefore, I believe that the responsibility of having two jobs and a full time class schedule has helped me master the skill of time management through the need to be self-sufficient.
	In conclusion, my time spent at SUNY Orange has made me into the leader I have always dreamt of becoming.  The time my professors set aside for me, and their generosity in doing so, has given me communication and teaching skills.  These skills, in addition to my time management achieved through my independence, have given me the essential characteristics of a leader; characteristics that have laid a solid foundation to build a successful future for years to come.

Architecture and Engineering Tutor for SUNY Orange- Fall 2013","This is my fourth and final semester at SUNY Orange. These past two years have made a huge impact on my life. There are many things that I’ve learned that will help me in my future education and in my career. I chose to study for an Associate’s Degree in Applied Science in Architecture while at SUNY Orange and later complete my path with a Bachelor’s Degree at a 4-year college. SUNY Orange has proven to me that I made the right choice.
It takes commitment to study in the field of Architecture. You have to organize your time efficiently in order to strive. This concept has taught me time management skills. My professors at SUNY Orange demanded quality work on time, which showed me the requirements of working at a typical architecture firm. They also taught many computer programs such as; Auto CAD, Revit, and Photoshop. These programs, along with hand drafting, are a requirement at many 4-year Architecture Colleges and firms. Presenting or proposing your idea to a client or professor is another necessary skill to have in order to be successful. I have had to prepare for and present many of my projects at SUNY Orange to my professors, chairs in the Architecture department, and other Architects. This has given me the experience to present my work with confidence to other schools or clients.
My extra-curricular activities have equally prepared me for my future. Being the Architecture club president has taught me leadership skills which will be useful in future endeavors. Joining the club has also brought me to many different locations on field trips which have impacted me as a person and has inspired my architectural design views. My position as a tutor has also shown me valuable communication skills.  
SUNY Orange has prepared me to take on the challenge of completing my road to become a successful Architect. I feel confident in taking on my future studies and positions in this field.

This school reminded me of how much I enjoyed learning as well as how important it is for the wellbeing of my future. At this school I discovered how much I am really capable of doing all on my own. I started to set out a clear path on where I want my life to go and all the things that I will have to do to in order to achieve my doctorate in Pharmacy. Besides, all the actual knowledge that I acquired here in the classes that I took at Suny Orange, I also learned a lot about life itself. Some of the specific skill that I acquired here  that I know will help me in the  future are: writing, speaking, team work, problem solving, initiative, stress management, attention to detail, time management, and independence.
Through the English classes I developed writing skills which are necessary in any career and school. Even if I change my mind in the future on what I want to be, I will always need to know how to write. Because of the communications class I have developed my ability to communicate with others more efficiently. I still do not feel comfortable speaking to a large crowd but at least now I have the tools I need to do my best and be well prepared, if it is ever a necessity. Another important skill I have developed further upon is team work. Class discussions and study groups encourage the individuals in the group to learn from one another and work together and that is something that we all have to be able to do specially in a professional level. I have learned team work not only in the classroom but also in tutoring, in the process of teaching someone something you learn something yourself and at the same time you reinforce the information that you already know. Something that I did not only learn but now understand because of Suny Ornage is Initiative. The power to take action and make things happen, something that other school and future employers will look for and value, something that everyone needs but may not necessarily have. A skill that I feel is very valuable specially in today’s society is stress management, because of all the things that as a full time student I was responsible for I know to take a breath in between tasks and collect my thought before continuing because moving forward while being overwhelmed does not yield good results.  As I shortly stated before, time management is something that I really had to keep up with while is school and I’m glad that I did because it works in my favor in my current job and I know it will also come in handy in the future. And lastly the love for knowledge is something that can never be taken from me, the more eager I am to learn a new job, task or method the more progress I’ll make in my profession. 
So to conclude this essay on how Suny Orange has prepared me for the future; it gave me the incentive I needed to plan ahead and finally decide to go on to a four year college. I have developed the intellectual confidence to know that I have what it takes to be successful at another school, and that I am capable of accomplishing so much in so little time if I put my mind to it. I am no longer intimidated by the college life and atmosphere because I was able to ease into it through Suny Orange.

SUNY Orange has taught me to come out of my comfort zone and attend seminars and activities that will benefit me in the future. While attending SUNY Orange I have greatly improved on my time management skills. While attending college full time, I also work part time at a local restaurant and in the business department at SUNY Orange, which is part of a work study program through the college. I assist with transportation and the care of a younger sibling while my mother attends college to prepare for a career change. Balancing school, two jobs and family responsibilities has been a challenge. However, SUNY Orange has taught me how to manage my time and with this knowledge I have successfully made the dean’s list four times. Time management skills will not only be a part of my education but a part of my future career. SUNY Orange has given me the education and life skills needed for my future.

I train mixed martial arts and I am an amateur boxer.","My education at SUNY Orange has prepared me for the future by helping me come to the realization of what profession I want to be involved in as well as what I want to accomplish in my life. Before I started attending SUNY Orange I did not really know what field I wanted to get involved in or what I would like to do with the rest of my life. I was interested in many different subjects and read a lot of books, but I did not yet know how I was going to apply my knowledge in school and then the job field. After my first semester I realized that I wanted to be a Sociology professor and teach young students that have the same interest in human society and human behavior that I do. I also want to do my own research and establish my own theories within the academic community about Human society and behavior. One of the aspects of my education at SUNY Orange that has helped me the most was the openness of most of the professors here because whenever I am writing an essay or doing any kind of assignment, I always try to incorporate something outside the box that expands on the bigger picture of life. I was kind of worried that some of the things I say would not be accepted or looked down upon, but they always said my assignments were very interesting and that they want to encourage originality and new ways of thinking. This is the impression that I got from most of my classes and from the school as a whole. This is the way my education at SUNY Orange has helped me the most because at the end of the day we don't get an education just to learn a bunch of information and be indoctrinated into a system where everybody thinks the same way. We go to school to expand on our consciousness and apply it to our experience of life.",,Checked

","        My education at Suny Orange has taught me a lot and has prepared me for the future in more ways than I could have imagined. In my general education classes I was able to learn a lot of valuable skills that will stick with me long after I am finished with college. Additionally, the atmosphere at Suny Orange is great and welcoming for students, especially new students who are trying to ease into the college experience. 
	At Suny Orange, I have learned how to think critically and use basic problem-solving skills which are essential for everyday life. In the time that I have spent at Suny Orange, I have met a very diverse group of people who have taught me to work and communicate more effectively with others. Throughout all my classes, I feel that I have been able to expand my general knowledge and this can also be attributed to faculty/staff and my fellow classmates. Having professors that are passionate about what they are teaching and being surrounded by other students who are eager to participate and learn has not only aided in my education, but has made it so much fun to learn. 
	Beyond that, my education at Suny Orange has taught me to push myself even harder to succeed. It has given me the confidence and ambition needed to continue on with my education. The education provided at Suny Orange has taught me skills that will help me excel in all my future endeavors and has given me a strong foundation to build my future career on.",,Checked

As a high school senior, I felt that I was not ready to leave home, and at eighteen years old, I was hesitant to make choices that would impact the rest of my life. Even though I still lived at home, adjusting to the different challenges college offered compared to high school took time, especially with the added requirements of the Honors Program. I felt a great deal of stress with my workload, but I was determined to chart these unfamiliar waters and succeed. 

Now that I am preparing to graduate, I reflect on my two years here at SUNY Orange with fondness and gratitude. The liberal arts major allowed me to take a range of classes, and the coursework challenged me in such a way that I grew confident enough to present projects to a class full of peers without feeling too nervous. Public speaking, a once terrifying thought, no longer distresses me or causes a sense of dread. 

My professors have always been driven to cultivate their students' knowledge and talents. Throughout high school, English was my strongest core subject, and teachers rarely offered much feedback concerning my essays. Once in college, my professors left comments on my papers that inevitably improved my skills. They helped me to become a stronger, more eloquent writer, and were eager to offer their assistance whenever it was needed. 

SUNY Orange has blessed me with opportunities and experiences I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Not only have I become a more confident public speaker and a better writer, but I have become more involved with my community. As an Honors Program requirement, I completed over 45 hours of community service during the Fall 2012-Spring 2013 academic year. I learned how to work with others in a professional setting when I volunteered at Thrall Library's Used Book Store, the Red Cross blood drive on campus, and the Voter Registration Drive that was also held on campus. I learned how to dedicate myself to a cause I cared about when last year, as a college freshman, I was one of seven students to attend the Northeast Regional Honors Conference (NRHC). I presented the legal, environmental, and economic implications of hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a local issue, and I would not have learned the skills I needed to research and present on this controversial issue without attending SUNY Orange. This was the first time any one from SUNY Orange was accepted to the NRHC, and I am still proud to have represented this amazing institution in a positive light. 

Most importantly, I have learned the significance of helping others. Although I completed my service learning requirement last year, I continue to volunteer at Thrall Library's Homework Help program, where I help elementary students with their homework and encourage them to improve and succeed the way my SUNY Orange professors have encouraged me. 

When I entered college, I was uncertain, shy, and more than a little nervous about my future. The liberal arts major allowed me to explore my various interests and expand my knowledge base, so that I am a more well-rounded young woman. I have improved as a public speaker, writer, and person, and I am thankful to SUNY Orange for helping me become who I am today. ","BARTLETT, JR. (GEORGE R. ""BUCKY"") MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP

The influence of professors and classmates, as well as the actual material presented, have given me an increased drive to learn and increase my commitment to completing higher education degrees in the future. The friends and connections I have made have prepared me for the future in invaluable ways. Through the Honors Program, clubs, and theatre productions, I have made lifelong friends with other students, and connections with faculty. These individuals have helped to positively shape my character, and contributed to the person I will become in the future. The leadership opportunities I have taken advantage of at SUNY Orange have prepared me for future professional and academic pursuits. Serving as the SUNY Orange Foundation Board Student Representative has equipped me to serve on boards in the future, as well as given me the opportunity to see the inner workings of SUNY Orange, and share my ideas regarding future plans for the institution. Advising freshman Honors Program students as a Peer Mentor has given me experience in leading and guiding other students, a quality which I believe will help me lead and assist others in the future. SUNY Orange is a unique institution, and my decision to attend is one of the best I have ever made. Skills I have acquired intellectually, socially, and in leadership have prepared me for my future both in other institutions of higher learning, and professionally. ",,Checked

I have also participated in 

various community service activities, but to remember dates of these events is asking for a 

miracle. I do not think it should be something to brag about either. We write it down on a 

form because it looks good, but I think actions speak louder than words. I am actively 

involved with assisted housing programs, shelters, and addiction centers that speak to our 

youth because I can relate to their situations. I think the biggest struggle is being heard and 

voicing an opinion. ","        Becoming a student at SUNY Orange has been a fulfilling and rewarding experience. 

While my career goals were once uncertain, my education at SUNY Orange has driven me 

to become very passionate towards my career choice. Upon beginning my studies my 

enthusiasm consisted of making it through my classes, but now I am driven by the desire of 

wanting to learn as much as I can related to my field.  An education at SUNY Orange has 

provide a solid foundation for my future. Through my hard work, commitment and 

perseverance, attending SUNY Orange has prepared me for the future in countless ways. 

	Even though attending college was not an option for me after graduating high school 

and I was unfortunately driven to be involved with the wrong group of people, I have 

learned that many of the decisions I made were based on bad judgment and lack of 

understanding as a result of my surroundings. My education at SUNY Orange has allowed 

me to view the world differently.  It has given me the ability to understand why people make 

the choices they decide to make under their given circumstances. It has allowed me to look 

at myself a lot closer than before and to understand the underlining problems that would 

have prevented my success in the past. I have learned to change old habits destructive to 

my future. I made a choice to change because being a student, learning, creating and 

exploring the world is much more important to me now that I have found my passion. My 

passion is creating art, but not just anything will do. I have learned here at SUNY Orange, 

art is recycled and reinvented. Therefore, I want to create something that is everlasting. 

	The last couple semesters my classes have consisted of primarily art courses, but that 

is not to say my other courses were a waste of time. I always view every course as 

preparation for the future. As in life when faced with various obstacles to overcome, they 

are merely stepping stones to prepare you for what is next. Being a college student you 

learn that you must do things which often seem impossible, but once over the first hurdle, 

the rest become easier to jump over. I can recall one of the first reading assignments I had 

which consisted of reading three chapters by the end of the week. At the time I thought it 

was impossible to read and comprehend the material provided the short amount of time, 

but the readings became easier to accomplish as my time management skills developed. 

       Before attending SUNY Orange things were always out of reach and situations seemed 

to never improve. It was a different mindset living on the streets. The hard work was not 

always rewarded and my character was often challenged. By being a student, I am 

rewarded with good grades because of my commitment to stay focused. In the classroom 

we are told to work together on labs or work together as part of a team for a project, 

emphasizing the importance of team building, networking and building relationships, but as 

an individual I learn that there will always be conflict and adversity among a larger group of 

people. Therefore, coming to a mutual agreement as in life is not always pleasant. The 

experience gained from the project at the end of the day should be the most important 

asset of all. As a student I have learned to be wary of misconceived notions towards others 

or certain situations until I am presented with all the facts. By being a student at SUNY 

Orange I am rewarded with the relationships I have developed during my time here. I am 

also rewarded with being able to display my work at the annual art show here on campus. 

As an art student being able to showcase one’s work always brings joy, fulfillment, and a 

sense of accomplishment. The annual art show helps create a great networking opportunity 

for students who want to develop further relationships within their field and this is all thanks 

to SUNY Orange. 

	If I could summarize in one word how SUNY Orange has prepared me for the future, 

the word I would use is hope. SUNY Orange has given me the hope that I somehow lost 

along the way. My life before college was very unpredictable. I was practically living on the 

streets a year before I enrolled and  my decision to attend was probably the best decision I 

have made. Yes, I could say that SUNY Orange has made a better person, that it has 

molded me into an almost perfect student, but I made the decision to change. SUNY Orange 

simply provided the motivation I needed to keep going. The professors were available when 

I needed extra help or just needed to talk. They were always encouraging and resourceful. 

Now that I am almost done with my last semester, the feeling of accomplishment and 

having overwhelming confidence is perhaps the best reward as a student that I have gained 

while attending SUNY Orange.

In regards to financial aid, although my family’s income is substantial, there will be 3 of us enrolled in college as of Fall 2014.  With one source of income, it makes attending college difficult.  Hopefully this is taken into consideration when making a financial decision.  ","SUNY Orange has successfully prepared me for my future.  From the time I started attending SUNY Orange, I was told that in order to get the most out of my experience, I should participate in at least one club or organization.  Doing so has given the chance to be active in campus life, volunteer my time at least weekly, and grow intellectually and academically.  From running a club to participating in the Socratic Method of honors classes, to planning and running events and presenting at a prestigious conference - all of this and much more has helped me set and maintain a solid GPA (Honors Program requires a 3.5 to graduate through the program), manage my time properly, boost up my confidence and significantly improve my public speaking skills.  I have also had some of the most influential staff members and professors to help me along my journey. Participation in all of these things has not been a completely smooth ride.  I have even learned from the few negative experiences encountered such as professors whose teaching styles were difficult for me, uncooperative classmates, and non-contributing club members.  From those examples, I have learned that in life, I will encounter people or situations that I may not enjoy but will have to put my differences aside in order to complete what needs to be done.

","	Academic excellence has been a defining characteristic throughout my educational career. I have always valued my education, and I continue to work to sharpen my intelligence. As a vibrant student, I try to enlighten myself with every chance I receive. Earning impressive grades throughout my two years at Orange County Community College and challenging myself along the way, I consider myself a scholar. 
	As a scholar, I seize every educational opportunity I can. My educational plans are to pursue my Bachelor’s degree and my MBA in the near future. I absorbed as much knowledge provided to me at SUNY Orange. Transferring to a four-year school will expand my knowledge even further and challenge me academically as a student by pushing me past my academic capability. With higher-level classes, I will be able to learn materials that I will be applying in my career. This will not only increase my knowledge, but also help me grow as a professional. 
	SUNY Orange provided me with the essential skill to succeed in the future. With honors and other business courses, I feel prepared to further my education at a four year school. I learned writing and presenting skill at SUNY Orange. Courses such as marketing, political science, and capstone helped me to become a better writer and a confident presenter. Along with classroom skills, I learned time management skill. Time is limited with school and work. However, professors at SUNY Orange taught me to manage my time efficiently. This helped me juggle work, school, and leisure time and maintain a 3.96 GPA. Teaching me to take responsibility for multiple activities trained me into becoming a well rounded professional. I will use these skills in my four-year institution and my career as well.
	 It was an exceptional opportunity to have more in-depth learning and experiences at SUNY Orange. I will am not only a better scholar but also have outstanding opportunities to further pursue my profession. SUNY Orange has prepared me to face new challenges in my future education and profession.

I work five days a week from 6am to 2pm at the same place for ten years.  I attend my internship placement on one of my days off form 9am to 5pm, on Fridays.  This semester, I attend school three times a week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.  Furthermore, I am a mother of two teenagers with a lot of extracurricular activities after school like, book club-twice a month, Sherpa club-twice a month, stage crew-lately everyday, Bokwa dance-every Monday, and religious education-every Thursdays. Organizing, prioritizing and planning each day is my daily activity in my house.  On my one day off, I try to spend as much time as possible with my family, although sometimes I have to spend extra time on school work.

","        I originally came from Poland.  Growing up in a bi-lingual and bi-cultural Polish speaking household has been both a challenging and rewarding experience. I speak, read, and write fluently in Polish; in addition I can communicate in Russian. As an immigrant who had only recently arrived, I had not been able to farther my education beyond high school.  With time and hard work, I have entered college in my thirties majoring in Human Services. Since a very young age, I have wanted to make myself useful to mankind and serve people to improve society.  My education at the State University of New York, in Orange County has adequately sculptured my future goals and desires, through ample sources of unlimited edification. It may not only serve as an access key for a prosperous future, but also it has improved me as a human being.  Moreover, the education has broadened my horizon and allowed me to discover a great world beyond my awareness.  The college experience has furthered my knowledge, allowed me to grow academically, and offered a professional preparedness. 
	 The internship in the Human Services field, through SUNY Orange, has prepared me for my future profession.  It has provided me with extensive and varied experiences in an educational setting.  Furthermore, the internship has presented me with challenges and responsibilities, where my current academic knowledge and skills have been enhanced.  As an intern in the Catholic Charities and Child Protective Services, I have acquired fundamental skill toward my future profession including, confidentiality, effective listening, healthy professional relationships, developing individual service plans, and supporting clients through proper referrals. I have gained knowledge of the importance of identifying verbal and nonverbal cues of clients through observation and interaction. In addition, I have attained communication skills through assistance during presentations in order to reach out to potential clients, moreover, I have been allowed to conduct an information sessions. I am prepared professionally, and I feel the college has equipped me with the essential skills in becoming an asset to my future employer.
  Through heterogeneous range of subjects, offered in the State University of New York, in Orange County, I have attained valuable skills to enhance my future.  The learning experience not only has provided me with broad academic foundations, but also has given me information that I can use in real life.  Moreover, my English language barrier has been lowering over time.  Multitasking, prioritizing, punctuality, resourcefulness, critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, commitment, and communication are some of my essential learned qualities which would be beneficial throughout my lifespan. Moreover, I have learned that things are not simply right and wrong or white and black, which opened my mind to unlimited possibilities of multiple visions, view points, and projections.   
	Remarkably, college activities have improved me as a human being and promoted my personal growth.  I have gained confidence, competence and became ambitious, open minded, self-assured, goal oriented, and self-driven.  My personal growth has allowed me to take risks and challenge myself.  Additionally, I have sharpened my sense of social responsibilities and acknowledged social problems within our society.  Through discovering myself, I have recognized my strengths and weaknesses. College has improved my social abilities and allowed me to converse across all topics with ease.  Personal growth, gained at school, has paved a path for my future success in my desired field. 
	Overall, my college experience thus far has caused a great awaking within myself.  I have acquired much, but I realize that there is much more to learn and do.  I feel that continued education and exploration will not only enhance my abilities but will allow me to give back to my community as my life progresses.

I started out with the goal of pursuing a career where I could use my skills to help others. I volunteered at nursing homes and signed up for classes that pertained to the human body. I enjoy the company of people and making a difference in their lives.  I delve into a nursing program which I believed would help me to obtain such a career. In the end, I was uncertain. 
I decided to put nursing aside when I could no longer take science or mathematical classes in conjunction with my nursing classes. At that particular moment I knew I love science. 
Professors introduced problems that I worked hard to solve. When presented with such challenging, conceptual problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry etc., I began to realize how enjoyable it was to solve these problems as they apply to mechanical engineering. I immersed myself in an environment where my peers and professors discussed different ideas about science, society and people. I thrive on it. 
Orange County Community College gave me the tools and confidence necessary for success. I can honestly say that if I have not taken this path I will not have the self-assurance to move on with my college education. I can confidently enter any classroom and study in accordance with what the subject is being taught. I have become adaptable, well-rounded and ready to take on the next chapter in my academic career. 
As much as I appreciate the rich education and guidance I have received at Orange County Community College, I know that I have received all that a community college has to offer, and that I must move on to a university. Moving on to a university means I continue to grow as a human being, introduce myself to new experiences and challenge my mind to think about ideas such as science on a different level.

","     During my first semester at SUNY Orange, I was unsure of my future goals. I knew that law was in my future plans and a transfer would be necessary, however I was not sure of the steps that would be required for these goals to be fulfilled. Being at SUNY Orange has helped me to become a more organized and prepared individual and it has helped me to set attainable goals. This has been in part to my experiences within student organizations here on campus. I have served as a treasurer in the Freud’s Fixations Club, secretary in both the Communication in Action Club and the Middletown Psychology Club, community service chair in the Middletown BOA and also as a Newburgh Senator. These experiences have enabled me to manage my time efficiently so that I can fulfill my duties. As part of being a secretary, I kept ahold of club records, record and keep minutes and keep an up-to-date record of all of club members. This organizational skill will come in handy in my future career and also in whatever endeavors I may choose to partake in. Transferring to a four year college will be a much different experience than it has been at SUNY Orange therefore; I will be required to be even more prepared and responsible as I juggle school and work.
     I have been able to set goals that I am positive will be achieved within a reasonable amount of time. After my second semester here, I set a goal to graduate from SUNY Orange within two years. As a result, rather than doing the average workload of twelve credits, I have done at least fifteen credits per semester thus making my goal of graduating in two years successful. SUNY Orange places a high value on education and it was this emphasis on education that encouraged me to strive for a GPA higher than 3.5. This has been achievable in part due to my focus on putting school first, paying attention in my classes and always staying on top of things. As a result, I have not only maintained a high GPA but also gained a membership into Phi Theta Kappa. Being able to set realistic goals is an important skill that individuals should learn. This will be able to help me in the workforce and ensure that I succeed in my chosen path.
     I am very grateful for my education and experiences here at SUNY Orange. I have been fortunate to have been taught by professors who had their students’ best interests at heart. My leadership role within clubs has also been beneficial because these skills will surely be of necessity in my future.

Attending SUNY Orange has changed my life in several ways and prepared myself for all of life’s endeavors. My education has shown me that hard work pays off; through my hard work I have been able to push myself toward achieving my goals and my desired career path. My dream to be an early education teacher would not have been possible without SUNY Orange. Before, I doubted my ability to attend college and excel. My experience with all the staff and faculty has shown me that with hard work and determination I was capable of doing anything; it was a second chance to turn my life around. By giving college a chance, I was able to achieve goals that I never thought possible, such as graduating with honors. I am currently on the dean’s list; never in my life had I thought that this was achievable. This college has taught me that second chances are possible and that they can change a life. In my education classes, I discovered a passion for teaching that I would have never found on my own. I know I can carry this passion into SUNY New Paltz and into my teaching career. SUNY Orange has truly prepared me for my future by teaching me the most important lesson; it taught me to believe in myself. Moreover, attending college has changed my overall being, my attitude on life, and helped me mature into an adult ready to leave this establishment with all the experiences and memories to help carry me throughout my life and prepare me for the road ahead.

When I first began attending SUNY Orange, I originally wanted to major in Psychology. I continued with this intended major for over a year and I will graduate with a Liberal Arts degree focused in Psychology. I have met many fantastic professors who have helped me expand my knowledge and I have found a new love for learning which I never had in high school. The professors I attended class with helped me a great amount in achieving my goals to become a doctor. My Biology professor was able to help me realize through his lectures that I want to major in Biology instead of Psychology. I find both very interesting but I am able to excel in a major I will love more and narrow down which field I want to go into when I graduate. When I become a doctor I want to be able to help people in a new way and give them alternatives to different drugs for their diseases. If I have never attended SUNY Orange I may never have realized I wanted to become a doctor and I would have never had the chance to become one either.

I also participated in the  Business Club and Student Senate in 2013. When I am not at school, I have two part-time jobs that fill up my schedule. ","I started taking classes at SUNY Orange during the fall after I graduated high school in 2011. I have since taken classes in subjects like engineering and computer programming as well as all the business classes that will allow me to complete my associates degree in Accounting in May. 

The broad range of classes that I have taken at OCCC have taught me different ways of analyzing problems. The math classes I have taken taught me how to solve a problem with a technical, formulaic approach. Engineering requires a more technical approach like math, leaving no room for error, especially in technical drawings and sketches. English research and writing papers demand a more literary approach, where problem solving does not necessarily bring you to one single answer. The difference between Math and English classes seems obvious to many people, but fewer realize the commonalities between the two. I think both have equally prepared me for hands on problem solving in the future. 

I tutored in the library when my schedule allowed for it. Tutoring was an interesting experience because my Trigonometry teacher recommended me for it, but it was much more challenging than I imagined it. I remember my first day of tutoring I was very nervous. I had never tutored a college level class before, and although I had already taken the class, I learned very quickly that the information was not as fresh in my mind as I had anticipated. It was a cool experience simply because of how much I learned from teaching someone else. This experience prepared me for my future, as I am now comfortable approaching other people's views and learning styles, and the importance of collaborating ideas so both people can learn from an experience can be applied to any group effort I am faced with.",,Checked

Science courses are time-consuming and surrounded with research. With constant problem solving and debate, there is room for exciting challenges to endeavor. Psychology was a course that I felt was full of captivating items that answer intriguing questions about life. I really enjoyed the discussions in class, especially with Professor Pernice's sense of humor. Also, I liked connecting the dots between these three courses because I find that they are essential to life and things start to make more sense. I didn't realize how much of an impact these courses have on pursuing my dental degree.

Throughout my two years at SUNY Orange, I have been pleased with the course work that was at hand. It kept me on my toes with each task thrown my way. I believe that SUNY Orange has prepared me for my future due to the professional help I was given and gave. I am a tutor for students in need of help in College Algebra courses. I was more diligent than ever when approached by Professor Avery to become a tutor. Furthermore, relationships with the students I helped have given me a more competent and efficient outlook in the job world.

Included in my daily routine was SUNY Orange's volleyball program. Being involved with a team sport changed things from studying individually to studying in groups with teammates who have similar interests in career goals.

I have been a leader of the girl scout troop while attending SUNY Orange. 

In 2006, I was fortunate enough to start receiving lessons from a Polish priest on how to play the organs as well as the piano. That same year I was given the opportunity to provide my community with the service of playing the organs during mass. I now voluntarily play the organs for three different churches and continue to expand my musical talent by practicing daily.

I also participated in the Breast Cancer Walk as part of community service for the Honors Program. It was a great learning experience and a wonderful opportunity to cheer on and support all of the survivors. 
","       Attending Orange County Community College was the best academic decision I have made. SUNY Orange provided me with great knowledge and intelligence. It gave me a wide variety of career options and it allowed me to further explore my interests in the field of Accounting. Attending SUNY Orange has been a wonderful experience because I have met incredible professors such as Professor Josephina Vondras and Professor Donald Urmston, as well as academic advisors that have helped me along the way of gaining a better education. Beginning my education at SUNY Orange being enrolled in the Honors Program provided me with a challenge and the opportunity to go above and beyond my capabilities. The Honors Program gave me opportunities to participate in community service activities, such as the Breast Cancer Walk. The biggest obstacle I have encountered in my life was coming to America in 2001 and not knowing the English language. With Polish being my primary language, I had difficulties with properly writing and communicating in English. The English department helped me tremendously in acquiring the necessary skills of how to write and communicate properly in English. The challenges I have encountered helped me gain confidence in myself, in public speaking, and in expressing my personal opinion. 
       After two years of obtaining an excellent education from SUNY Orange, I am now ready to continue my studies at a four-year institution working towards receiving a Bachelor’s Degree. I am planning to graduate SUNY Orange and a four-year institution in Accounting in hopes of obtaining a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license. The high-quality academic courses and programs provided by the college motivated me by giving me the necessary tools to take an extra step and be the best that I can be. SUNY Orange has prepared me for the future by assisting me in gaining confidence, in working hard, and in overcoming many obstacles. By having the opportunity to study at SUNY Orange, I have learned to never give up because there will always be a way to achieve success and acquire valuable opportunities.

Through the program I have matured as a young adult and become more informed and interested in the world of today. The seminars I’ve participated in have led to a better understanding on issues and opened me up to new viewpoints and opinions I’ve never considered before. “Guns in America” led by Professor Cacciatore was one of the seminars I attended and has opened my eyes to the fact that there is no simple solution to any complex problem. Another aspect of the honors program that has greatly enhanced my experience here was the Capstone. I have learned to overcome my limitations and that anything is possible with determination. The 25 page Capstone when first introduced to us appeared as a daunting, impossible task. Now that we are almost done, we can’t help but feel proud of our accomplishments.

I had a negative view of the college and was attending another college in New Jersey. However, in May 2012, I was partially paralyzed and hospitalized for three days. I was unable to walk or talk for several hours, then I spent the next month re-learning how to walk without a cane. It was due to my sheer exhaustion and stress of working full time, going to school full time, 3 hours round trip, and taking care of my family. It was at this moment that I realized I would need to make a few changes, including attending a closer college, if I wanted to continue my education. This lead me to SUNY Orange, and I have been thankful ever since. My educational experience at SUNY Orange has prepared me for my future educational endeavors in a number of ways. This experience has shown me diversity, facing challenges and overcoming them, and that I can do it. When I was kicked out of my classes, due to not paying a $50 registration fee, and I wasn't able to re-register for them, I quickly learned how to problem-solve, change the approach, and never give up. I thank both Susan Mansueto and Dr. Frank Traeger for showing me that persistence and dedication pays off; I was able to register and complete my dropped classes. I made a promise to Dr. Traeger, which I have kept to this day, "" I promise if you give me a change, I will be the best student in your program,"" and I have done my best to keep that promise, every semester. In working with the writing center, I gained perspective and additional creative writing skills. With my math classes, I learned the importance of community and studying skills. Because I had not taken a math class in over 12 years, I learned to seek out the assistance of a tutor and the Math Lab, work harder & smarter, and still end successfully. Trigonometry was one of the most challenging subjects, for me, at Suny Orange, and with a lot of help from dedicated professors, like Professor Lavorgna, several Math Lab tutors and staff, and my personal tutor, I succeeded. Being a part of the child's health day and the Exercise Studies program showed me how important health is and how much of an impact stress can have on your life. There were many valuable lessons I have learned and experienced at SUNY Orange and I am confident these will help me continue to grow and progress as a student, as a person, a mother, wife, and Physician. I am thrilled to have this experience and it has changed my outlook on our community. ",,Checked

Community Service at The Holy Fathers Russian Orthodox of the Seven Ecumenical Councils ","My education at SUNY Orange has prepared me for the future in ways I couldn’t possibly imagine. When I first made the decision to come to SUNY Orange I will be honest, it wasn’t where I wanted to be. Growing up in a family of eight I knew we didn’t have much in the way of money. Also seeing all my friends go off on their own to start at a real college made me sad. I knew I had to get a job and start helping out my family any way I can. After three years at this institution I can now say I never had any reason to be sad in the first place. The connections I made with friends that I know will make something of themselves. The teachers I befriended with real world experience and wisdom. Getting to find out who I am and what I want in life. All of this was because of SUNY Orange and I can’t begin to thank the school. Some people are ashamed to say they went to a community college, but not me. When I start the next chapter of my life at Rochester Institute of Technology I will proudly stand up and say I’m a SUNY Orange alumnus. Getting back to the main point of how this school has prepared me for the future. The people I meet, the things I learned will all help me when I’m out in the real world trying to make something of myself. SUNY Orange has helped me become the man I was meant to be.

On top of all of that, I also babysit my younger brother quite often and I help my parents when needed by picking him up from daycare after I get home from school and or work, depending on the day.
","My time at SUNY Orange I believe has greatly prepared me for my future endeavors. Come May, I will I have attended SUNY Orange for four full semesters, and one summer semester, and through all of these classes, I have truly learned what it is like to grow up and become an adult. Attending SUNY Orange, has taught me how to become more responsible with money as well as the importance of a job in order to pay for my schooling. Transportation every week costs me forty dollars and on top of that I have had to pay around 500 dollars a semester for school books. All of these fees I have primarily payed for by myself, and I am proud of my accomplishments. Prior to attending college I will admit I did not pay for anything and I was driven wherever I needed to go. I am glad that I attended a community college because it really made me grow up and take on more responsibilities. I have had to juggle both school and a job and I am extremely proud of myself and I do not believe I would have gained these accomplishments if it hadn't been for attending SUNY Orange. With the support of teachers, family, and friends, I have been able to be successful in school as well as excel in the workplace. In four short semesters I learned what it is like to be a functioning member of society and I have also learned to not be quite so dependent on my parents. This experience in all has prepared me for the future more than any class ever could and for that, I am grateful to have attended this college and met the individuals that I did.",,Checked

When I first entered SUNY Orange my freshmen year I was unsure about the major I had chosen. I started off working towards a degree in Radiologic Technology but then a semester later I decided to change to a Networking degree. I have always been very interested in learning about computers and learning about what really goes on behind the scenes of those complex machines most of us use in our everyday lives. Another semester went by and I decided to speak with my guidance counselor about changing my major for the second time. Cyber Security peaked my interest a little bit more than the Networking degree.  

       I have never thought about going into law enforcement until the Fall of 2013 after speaking with a correction officer.  My professor Dr. Lanausse was able to bring in an Investigator to share some of his experiences with the class from working in the field and working in a forensic laboratory environment. This was another influence that made me decide to stick with my Cyber Security degree.  I signed up to take the State Trooper exam in Fall of 2013 but could not make it to my designated exam date because I ended up in the hospital the same day as the exam.  This was unfortunate because the State Trooper exam is only available every 4 years or so. Now that I am graduating this Summer 2014 with a degree in Cyber Security I have recently decided that I want to further my education by obtaining my bachelors in Information Technology from Mount Saint Mary College.
	
       Throughout the years of working on my degree and trying to plan for my future career I have had some struggles. Everyone has struggles in various shapes and forms but I am just thankful to have had a helpful and understanding environment to work through those obstacles. SUNY Orange has helped me go from being a nervous freshman to a confident graduate with high hopes for the future. This is how I feel SUNY Orange has prepared me for the future, by giving me options and a strong support network they have helped me find my career path.

   ","My time at SUNY Orange has taught me a lot about myself and about the future that awaits me. When I was a freshman, I was pretty set on pursuing a career in nursing since I was already so immersed in the health care field since my time in the Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) program that I completed at BOCES in high school. I didn’t really take the time to explore any other viable options that were available to me out there. So, I had the idea of piling up my course load so that I could quickly get on the fast track to the nursing program. But I soon realized that I was trying to bite off more than I could chew and ended up taking about 15 credits, and, on top of that, trying to juggle a new job. It ended up being too much for me to handle and I decided to take a break from school and, instead, dedicate myself to my new job. But, with so much time off of school, I started to realize how much I needed to continue my education. I don’t want to be stuck working as a CNA for the rest of my life and I really needed to continue my studies so that I could pursue the career that I’ve always wanted.
And, during my time off of school, I realized that I didn’t want to pursue a career in nursing after all. I got exposed to the nursing field at my job and I’ve seen what nurses have to go through on a day-to-day basis and it has discouraged me from continuing to pursue nursing as a career. So, I decided to resume my studies once again in the fall 2012 semester. I wanted to start fresh and to pursue a major that would offer me fulfillment, so I settled on Human Services because it combined a lot of the things I was really interested in, like sociology, psychology, and helping others. But, after taking the course, Intro to Human Services, I found that it wasn’t what I really expected. So, I decided to switch my major, again, to Psychology, and this time, I think I’ve made the best choice for myself. I absolutely love Psychology and all the psychology courses I’ve taken over the past two years have really helped me realize this. I’ve always been fascinated by the material provided in the courses and it’s been very eye opening and intriguing.  
So, in short, SUNY Orange has helped me prepare for my future in the best way possible because it introduced me to my future career and I’m really happy that my time at OCCC has helped me to finally see what it is that I want to do with life.

As the first institution of higher learning I have attended, I am content with the knowledge I gained during my time at SUNY Orange. I know that the foundation I received here will carry on in my future studies, no matter the place. Whether, it was my Comparative Studies class, Biology, Anthropology, Humanities or Intro to Art, the knowledge I gained in each class has fueled my desire to continue my education. But, it was just not the content of the class, the dedication and enthusiasm I saw from the faculty enhanced the learning environment. The dedication from the staff is something I hope my future college can match. Furthermore, SUNY Orange has provided a comfortable level of difficulty. This has allowed me to establish a certain amount of academic independence, although the ability to ask for help was always there. I have been able to do many presentations and research papers with the aid of mentors. This has had a positive impact on my confidence as a writer and presenter.

","I currently attend SUNY Orange, majoring in Engineering Science.  As I prepare to venture off to pursue my bacculerate degree in petroleum engineering at Louisiana State University, I feel completely prepared for my next level of education. Over the last two years, SUNY Orange has taught me discipline and focus, to challenge myself, and to work towards overcoming any unforeseen obstacles. These qualities would be invaluable as I prepare for this next chapter in my life.

	A college education is often tied to our personal dreams about what we want our life to be. We grow up hearing that college is a necessity and we should go right after high school, but some of us are not ready.  Many people, like myself are starting college later in life, after we have had a chance to get some work experience.  However, the choices we make early in life can affect our future in the long run.  I realize that education is a substantial factor in our lives. Its plays a fundamental role in our future. Society keeps getting more competitive day-by-day, requiring people to adapt to greater demands. SUNY Orange plays an essential role in this drive to be on top of the game, by providing the higher education needed by students to pursue their career goals. 
 	
SUNY Orange has prepared me for life by showing me how to be responsible.  I have learned proper time management and how to handle a large workload.  College has also taught me socialization skills.  I learned how to network with people to broaden my horizons. No matter what your major is, communication will play a significant role in your career. In order to even begin your career, you will most likely have an interview that could be looked at as a test of your communication skills.
	
At SUNY Orange, I received ample individual attention from my professors who went above and beyond providing excellent engineering preparation. With electives in Humanities and Social Sciences, I was able to grow in the understanding of the complex, social, political and economic events. I learned to communicate effectively and gained a broad academic foundation. SUNY Orange enabled me to reach my full potential and also to gain a broad intellectual foundation. Because of the rigorous engineering program, I was able to expand my skill set adding powerful analytical and problem solving skills. I consider myself lucky to have the privilege of being an engineering student in a lively, diverse and attractive campus such as SUNY Orange.

The program I volunteer for is the Gleaning Program, which is run by the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Orange County. The program works with locals farmers who donate excess produce, so that it can be dispersed to local food pantries. I last volunteered in November of 2013. I spent two days that month in the field. The first day, at Penning's Farm in Warwick, I picked apples from trees and boxed them for transport. The second day, at Sycamore Farms in Middletown, I spent the day sorting through produce, boxing them and loading the truck for transport. ","SUNY Orange provided me with the confidence needed to become an accomplished student, as well as the educational background essential to earning a Bachelor’s degree. When I began taking classes in the Spring semester of 2012, I had no idea what it would take to succeed. The end goal was not clear, and I did not know what to expect. The thought of starting this journey was scary, but after the first semester at SUNY Orange, I realized there was nothing to fear. The professors provided the tools that I needed to keep me from being overwhelmed. My time spent at SUNY Orange has been positive and has prepared me for my future.
After leaving high school, I chose not to go to college, and instead, I joined the workforce. During those years, I would often scoff at my colleagues that were college students. They would frequently complain about term papers and homework, of which I did not have to worry. However, the truth was, I had no confidence that I could succeed as a student. Battling with my abysmal writing skills and a fear of failure, there was little hope of increasing my level of education. Those fears have since subsided because of the tools I learned at SUNY Orange. This first happened when my English 101 professor broke down how to write an essay. By reducing it to the most basic elements, paper writing became as easy as filling in the blanks. Something as simple as learning proper formatting gave me the confidence I needed to excel. Now I have completed four semesters and am about to obtain my Associate's in Science degree; the fear and lack of confidence I once had is gone. As I move forward, I do so with a better perspective of myself and my capabilities. 
Making the decision to go to back to school was easier than choosing a major. With so many choices and my entire future at stake, the pressure to choose correctly was immense. I picked accounting because I am confident with numbers, the salary is adequate, and there is versatility in the jobs that need accountants. After making the decision and plunging in to my first semester, I found that I did not know anything about the accounting profession. I was faced with a litany of new words and phrases. Admittedly, I thought I had made a mistake. However, the course curriculum was structured in such a way that information from one class helped me in another. This organization allowed me to absorb new information easily. I applied the same vocabulary and theory throughout all of my classes. It became clear that I had not erred in my decision and am now eager to continue my education. My initial plan was to get my Associate's degree and then decide whether school was the right choice. Now, I am ready to start on my Bachelor's degree at a four year university, with plans of completing my Master’s as well.
My experience at SUNY Orange has been exceedingly positive. It has given me the courage to complete my education and has provided me with a solid foundation in accounting. In my interim, I have excelled in my studies and have a strong desire to continue. Even though the classes that I have taken were difficult, and the homework was daunting, I have reached the finish line as a stronger student. The knowledge that I have gained is invaluable. I am confident in my abilities and am positive that I will make an impact at my next university and in my future career.

Not only have I learned and improved academically, but I have grown in other areas of my life as well; areas where I did not for see SUNY Orange playing a role.  When I came to SUNY Orange I was lost to say the least. I had just finished a semester at a four year school during which time I did not have a favorable experience, I was  unhappy in many areas that pertained to my schooling and life so, I decided to come home.  Since my time at SUNY orange I have discovered so much  about myself and I feel like I am now on a good path and have figured out what I want to do with my life.  I have realized that if I push myself I can achieve more than I thought was possible and so with that, I want to reach for the stars and achieve my dreams. I no longer  have the  ability to say something  is too hard or not worth it. I have so much more drive and  confidence in myself and in my work since my time here.  I have learned  that it is okay not to know what your next step is, that if you are open to try things and learn in all types of areas you may find something you love, something you didn't see before.  When I came home from the last four year school I attended I was timid , scared and had given up. I thought that I no longer cared and that school wasn't for me. I figured I'd just get a two year degree and that would be it. But after taking classes and having phenomenal teachers, who were interested in my life and not just my grades, I saw that I wanted more for myself. With the encouragement of the SUNY Orange teachers, the knowledge and the confidence they have given me, I feel prepared to conquer the world, or at least my world. I am excited to go to another school and continue my education and one day reach the goals I can now set for myself knowing that I am strong and intelligent.  SUNY Orange has had a huge impact in my life. I honestly don't know where I would be in life if I had not come to this school, I am so thankful that I did. ",,Checked

It was a terrible injustice in many ways, but mainly because this was this students ONLY mode of transportation. I was upset and found it unacceptable that a SUNY School didn't have bike racks for students to use. This event also discouraged students from using green and sustainable transportation for themselves. It was such an unbelievable reality that was so ridiculous, that I felt the need to try and fix it, and surprisingly, fix it I did. Through primarily my efforts I went to the school’s safety and security committee, which I was a voting member of, the sustainability committee, and the student senate, which I also was a member of, to gain support for my bike riding resolutions. The resolutions would allow students to ride their bikes to the campus and be able to park their bikes in a safe area on campus as well. After the resolutions passed, I did all of the primary research for the cost and delivery of bike racks for the school, since it had none at the time. With help from the sustainability committee I was able to have the bike racks ordered and installed by the next semester, which was the fall semester of this school year (2013). I was happy to see the bike racks being used by students, and bike use in general increasing this year. It was a wonderful victory that wasn’t easy. There was opposition from a few members of the safety and security committee as well as members of the administration that worried about liability insurance rates. However the greater interests of the students and green transportation prevailed over frivolous and somewhat ridiculous concerns. It was an interesting and rewarding experience in school politics to say the least. You may check with professor William Stillman, the chair of the safety and security committee about this, and Kirsten Gabrielsen, the chair of the sustainability committee at the time. In this current academic year (2013-2014) I was the student senate treasurer and funded all the clubs, within our budget, and had a surplus left over. Everyone got to go on lots of fun trips and activities. I also obtained new, better, more powerful and bigger microwaves for the cafeteria, the bottom of Harriman Hall and in the Bio Tech building, to be enjoyed by everyone.   This academic year also marked the 2nd year in a row that I volunteered as a part of the IRS certified VITA tax preparer program, where students and people from the community can come in and have their Federal and State income taxes prepared for free, with help from volunteers like me. You can confirm with Professor Daryl Goldberg about this if you like. I am a member of the Billiards club and Art club in order to hang out with my fellow students and meet new and different people. I would join other clubs like the business club if I had more time, but taking 17 credits and maintaining a 4.0 GPA isn't easy. I also try to catch a few SUNY Orange sporting events here and there, like the baseball games across from the Mount Carmel school next to Saint Alberts, those are kinda cool. ","SUNY Orange has given me the confidence to continue in my educational endeavors. The teaching staff here is mostly excellent, but there are a few bad apples. Most are nice, caring and genuinely concerned about the student learning and obtaining the education and goals that they want. That is a huge plus for school to have, great teachers. Mr. Morocho rekindled my love for math, I would say he is one of the best math teachers the school has. His sense of humor and willingness to help when you needed it was priceless. He demands a lot from the student and his online homework and quizzes take a lot of time, but you really learn the material, so when the exam comes you know it and pass easily. He uses the online my math lab program which at first I was concerned about, but after using it, I liked it a lot since if you got stuck, it would show you how to do the problem step by step and then give you a similar one to complete for homework credit. Thus, Saving time and letting you learn instantly, versus having to wait until the next class to ask a question to learn that, and then be behind trying to learn the new stuff for the day. The only problem was it was picky with the input of the answers, you had to type it just right. Like 2.5 is not the same as 2 1/2, but it is. However Mr. Morocho was more than willing to go in and check what you put and give credit where appropriate, so it was good. Mr. Morocho also had online office hours if you couldn't make any of his physical office hour times, which I found amazing and ahead of the curve, plus it was a really nice thing for him to offer. Although I never used it, I knew a few students who did and they said it was fun to be able to get help at 8pm on a monday night with a math problem. Looking back on it, his online components gave me the courage to try an online only class. I ended up taking Business and society online and did very well, despite the exams being a little high pressure, with only 50 min. for a 50 question exam, but I got used to it and am now confident to take other online classes. Professor Tom Stack in the business department is really good too, he presents the ideas clearly and on a level that you easily understand them. He responds to all questions nicely and not with an attitude, that is very important. I got through accounting principals one with him and it made me go on in accounting. If I had a bad teacher or a bad experience, I may have not come back. Professor stack and the fellow accounting teachers have taught me enough to have confidence moving ahead in accounting. Which brings me to the math lab, this is an amazing school to have such a thing.  You can show up at almost any point in the day and get math help on anything from algebra to calculus 3 to discreet math, for free. I have been to another SUNY school and wow, they were no where near as nice or supportive as SUNY Orange. I can't thank the math lab enough. There is also a tutoring center in the library where student tutors are available for free, if you need, but I never used that. I will say SUNY Orange really cares and does have a great support system if you need it. Hopefully you know its there and how to use it. Communication is key and the school could work on that. Overall I am happy with the education I received at SUNY Orange, I have learned enough to be a full time bookkeeper if I wanted, or I could open up my own income tax business if I wanted. Since I am doing so well academically, I am continuing on to earn a 4 year degree and be a more valuable person in the job market. SUNY Orange has a good transfer program with other SUNY schools as well as other non SUNY schools, so a lot of my credits will transfer and that's good. Getting involved with the student senate has made me more of a social person, which is kind of the opposite of what I was when I showed up here. I have actually had a positive impact and have altered this school permanently in good ways for the future. I am able to feel accomplished and have learned that in some ways, you do have a voice, and can change things for the better. Hopefully I can continue that spirit in the future, and come back years from now and still see the bike racks that I helped get installed.  =) ","I am interested in The GOLUB (MAX H.)

I did a lot of growing up while attending this college.  I began here right out of High School in 2007; a time where I was undecided what major to choose and if I even wanted to get a degree; I then learned about the Radiologic Technology program that SUNY Orange offered. Immediately I knew this is what I wanted to do and began to take all the prerequisites in order to get into the program.  I worked hard to get the grades to be accepted into this competitive program and started the Rad Tech program here September 2010.  Being in this program helped me grow up and mature into the person I am today.  The amount of class work that was being thrown at me made me overwhelmed at first, but only made me take school even more serious and not be distracted from the life of just turning 21 years old.  The school sent me to many clinical sites such as Vassar Brother Hospital and Orange Regional Medical Center, where I got the best learning experiences; I learned a whole lot about my self and how much I enjoy taking care of others and being able to make a difference in someone's life.  I graduated the summer of 2012 with a GPA of 3.64 and was employed 2 months later with a full time job at a Medical Office in Newburgh.  Being a graduate of SUNY Orange, I was fully prepared and felt confident in my skills learned from school to do the job I was trained to do.  However,  I recently become unemployed as of December 2013 due to downsizing, but I am taking this chance to further my education in the medical field.  I now feel like I am capable of doing even more after completing this intense program and acquiring job experience.  My goal is to transfer to a four year school and complete my BA in Biology or in some type of Pre-Health degree and then apply to graduate school to become a Physician Assistant; a degree that I have become very passionate about pursuing.  It is a very competitive field to get into but I am 100% confident that I have what it takes.  I'm excited for the future and can definitely say that I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't attended SUNY Orange.",,Checked

In OCCC, the most benefit of learning the knowledge is that they give you a chance to know about this major and what you will be doing in the future. For example that happened on myself when i changing my major, i felt that i am glad that i changed my major and it is not too late to change it yet. The education at Suny Orange prepared me to get ready for a four year college, and also prepared me to choose the right major and job what i want to be in the future. I am glad that i attend into SUNY Orange for my college study. In SUNY ORANGE, there has a caneer office, which using a test which called ""FOCUS"" and helping me to figure out which field i want to be. they also provide a connect which can connection me with somebody who is work in that field. In this way, i can know more detail about things that their job doing and see if it is what i want to be in the future.

My degree requirements have enabled me to take courses that I would not have normally taken. These courses broadened my knowledge in many areas and made me a better-rounded person.  I was able to apply material learned with my job, my family, and my children.  My education at SUNY Orange in addition to the college setting has given me the confidence I need to further my education.  The interactions with my professors as well as my classmates have made me excited to transfer to a four-year college and continue my post high school college education which I had to put on hold.  I attended SUNY Orange in 2004-2005 then came back in 2012.  My experiences have been positive and the changes made to the college during my absence have greatly contributed to this positive experience.  The Academic Advisors (especially Peter Cutty) are attentive and caring and have addressed all my concerns each and every time I needed to see them.  I did not feel like just another number once I sat with them but instead a student whose education and success they truly cared about.  I will miss this personal attention and can only hope I will continue to experience such professionalism at my new school.  I have a 16-year old son who will be graduating from High School next year.  If he decided not to go away to college I would recommend and encourage him to attend SUNY Orange.  

It has been an honor and privilege to attend SUNY Orange and join those who have graduated before me.  I feel fortunate knowing that I received an excellent education while still being able to provide for my family (due to the affordable tuition). I am a role model to my five children and have proven that anything is possible if you are determined and willing to work hard.  I will miss the staff and school tremendously and will never forget all that I have learned at SUNY Orange.",,Checked

I call it an investment because I payed to not only get the education that is offered but so much more that adds to the whole experience. SUNY Orange has definitely given me the key tools for success for the future and I feel that I am very well prepared for what is up ahead. All of my professors have each taught me numerous amounts of knowledge but getting to know them outside of the classroom especially asking for extra help with exams has taught me one very important valuable lesson: you can do anything you want to do as long as you are persistent, work hard, and never NEVER give up! I live by these words everyday and try to be the best possible me that I can be every day and it does pay off. SUNY Orange has made the transition from high school to the college level very comforting and gave me the courage and knowledge I will need to go after my dreams. I also enjoyed the honor program at SUNY orange because you get to know students similar to yourself a lot faster and the honor program offers very interesting seminars that are very enjoyable. The honor program has also helped me with my educational goals and at times has pushed me where I did not think I could go or accomplish something but I did and it felt so good and proud when I was finished.

I remember reading these lines off a poster while I was first registering for classes in the Shepard building, just two years ago. What SUNY Orange has given me in those two years is something words can not even describe. How can one describe the feeling of being closer to one's dream ?  I guess I can say that I feel like Icarus flying towards the heavens; only my wings will not melt. I will continue to fly. I can barely scratch the surface of how much of a dramatic  impact SUNY Orange has had on me. I remember learning how to ""ask good questions"" from Professor Givant, and learning that I should not just accept a thesis from a book because it is written by a well known scholar from Professor McCoy. I have learned about the Greeks and the Romans from Professor Kontoss and learned the history of the modern and ancient worlds from Professor Schunk and Dr. Strmiska. Before SUNY Orange, I was a poor young adolescent from Highlandmills, New York, just trying to help his mom pay bills; with a dream of one day becoming great. Now, in May I will be a graduate of SUNY Orange, and be one step closer to making my dream into a reality. One day I hope I am able to repay the college for the grand education and experiences it gave me. Thank you for teaching me to pursue my dreams. ","BARTLETT, JR. (GEORGE R.

Prior to starting my first semester, I thought that the school work would be harder than high school, but easier than a four year institution. After my first semester I realized that I had to change everything about how I looked at my life. In high school the teachers tell a student when they are not doing well in class and offer to help them understand the material better. In college the only one who has to care about a student’s grade is the student themselves. I didn’t enjoy taking some of my classes, but I had to care about my grade. I needed to do my homework and make time to study, because I wanted the highest grade I could obtain. I realized that where I am in the future is determined by how much I actually care. When I put the time and effort into studying, then I received a grade that I was satisfied with. I didn’t want a high grade just to have it. I wanted it, because if I wanted to be in a good four year college and have a career in my major, then I had to take my life seriously and focus.

My experience at SUNY Orange has taught me a great deal about myself and has been very positive in both my personal and academic development. As a Biology Major, I was given the opportunity to set high goals and challenge myself above and beyond my capabilities with the amount of work expected to achieve great results. These courses helped me gain confidence in myself, participate in class discussions and express my opinion. I achieved great skills in order to strive for excellence and take pride in my work. Furthermore,  participating in the schools Chemistry and Biology Club helped me meet great friends and faculty members.

By being involved in student’s lives and connecting with some of the staff and faculty members, it has certainly helped me find my identity. It also has set me up for great success and has unlocked plentiful opportunities to take on and take great advantage of. 
I gained skills that cannot be taught. Through interactions with fellow students, professors, internship supervisors, and coworkers, as well as other college staff, I earned a ""degree"" in people and social skills that I did not even sign up for. I learned an excessive amount about myself during my two years in college. I was faced with challenges that I never thought I would come across and in return, I have become a more assertive individual. I am sure that my passion and aptitude in the legal world in combination with my confidence as an intern at the Orange County District Attorney’s Office will permit me to be prosperous in the criminal justice world.
My time at SUNY Orange was absolutely a time of sure growth as a student. The various clubs and organizations including but not limited to; The Newburgh Student Senate, Newburgh Board of Activities and Communication In Action Club, have allowed me to focus on the growth and extraordinary experiences as a student and learner in those areas of being involved in and around campus. Also by taking on a bigger responsibility by becoming a voting member in a couple of committees at SUNY Orange, I have become more involved with the college sub-culture. I firmly believe that I’ve impacted this college in ways that I would have never even thought possible. I grew as a student who is a very active in my community, here at SUNY Orange. These are just a few of what SUNY Orange has done to let me grow as a student.
But not only has this institution allowed me to grow, but so have the people. In the college, the teachers, the advisors, the “higher-ups”, and everyone else in between really care about their students and help them along when needed. Likewise every student at SUNY Orange, really strives to learn. The combination of the two make for a compact and encouraging learning community that truly cultivates not just learning, but also development of the learner as a student.
The list is as endless as the single topics that I’ve learned about. The final important thing to state is that this is an unending growth cycle. Even after SUNY Orange I’ll be continually growing as a learner (same as a student in this case) and continue to succeed and strive as a student leader to my peers and be looked upon as an achiever. I will take everything that SUNY Orange has taught me to the future universities I attend and especially apply them to my career and aspirations.

","My education at Suny Orange has prepared me for my future in more ways than just an education. I have had the most amazing experience here at the Suny Orange dental hygiene program. This program, although difficult and exhausting at times, has prepared me more than I could have asked for in my soon to be future in the real world. I would have to begin by saying the curriculum is 100 percent exactly what is needed to be prepared for a future as a dental hygienist. I recently attended a National Board Review weekend seminar training to prepare this years graduates for there licensure. I felt more than prepared and even confident once attending this seminar at just how much information and knowledge and education I have received from this college. Secondly my professors are above and beyond great educators. They have each individually taught me the necessary skills I will need to be successful in my future. All of my professors are well versed at their subjects and have taught them and communicated those subjects to myself and my classmates in the best way I think possible. Along side the curriculum at Suny Orange and the great teaching skills of my professors. I also feel that the program in itself is one of the best programs given in the nation to prepare us for the clinical world. Being able to see patients on a day to day basis, treating them, building relationships with them, and having every possible experience you can with them has been the most rewarding part of my preparation for the future. I have learned and become experienced in so many clinical aspects that I never knew I could accomplish just in school. The ability to leave campus and work in the local Veterans hospital and being able to see how a ""outside"" clinic is run, was by far the best experience. I truly feel very prepared to start working and furthering my education the day I graduate. I am confident in both this college and my professors that I will pass my boards and be eligible for licensure. Suny  Orange has prepared me for my future in more ways than one. I plan to continue my education and one day become an educator myself, and I have relationships with all my professors and with there guidance I know I can succeed. I have been given and taught clinical experiences from children to adults to the elderly, and have been given the opportunity to work in a setting outside of the school clinic which will help me and guide me  for the rest of my career. I have been given chances to work within the pediatric wellness fair, and open house fairs; all of these things have prepared me and continues to prepare me for my future. I will admit that I was worried at just how much I would learn from a community college, but am so grateful at taking the leap of faith and trusting the reputation of the college at the amazing education I have been provided here at this college. I have the education, clinical experience, and molded clinician personality to truly succeed in my future as a health care provider and one day a professor in my own field. I have been given the confidence and structure, support, and lending hands to make my future as a professor ever more easy, rewarding, and attainable. Suny Orange has prepared me for my future in any occupation I choose to follow in this field and for that I will forever be grateful. I hope to be able to be given yet another opprotunity to continue my education with any scholarship I may be offered. Another whole hearted reason Suny Orange has prepared me for the future. This college has truly assisted me and aided me in affording this education and I hope to one day as Alumni be able to give back.

The first reason was because I was not prepared for college level work and the second because I was bitter about not being able to attend the colleges I wanted to. It was rough the last few years of high school because at that time I was still caring for my sick parents. When my father was diagnosed with cancer in April of 2008, I saw my performance of school work start to slip. My grades began to go down at the most crucial time of high school (sophomore and junior year). This led to rejection from all of the four-year colleges I applied to. This would leave most high school seniors sad and depressed for a while, but I knew I must attend school to follow my dream of becoming an athletic trainer. This is when I chose SUNY Orange. I heard about SUNY Orange's Exercise Studies program and though it might be an adequate start to my education in the sports medicine field. I am proud to say it was. SUNY Orange has prepared me for the challenges ahead from a four-year college and life.

After a year of college experience, making new friends and obtaining decent grades, I knew the route I wanted to take was sports medicine. SUNY Orange has an Exercise Science program that I am glad to be a part of currently and soon to be alumni. Going for an A.S. in Exercise Science along with academic merit awards and Dean's List recognition I think is a great head start into the field of sports medicine. During my time at SUNY Orange I attended many seminars, symposiums and continuing education classes to heighten my knowledge in the field. I have also had to do projects that are based along the lines of a Master’s based thesis project. The coursework at SUNY Orange has also prepared me for what lies ahead in the future.

SUNY Orange has taught me a variety of things in the field of exercise science. My professors have shown me the all that I have to know in order to prepare me for a four-year institution and even my future career. Being an exercise science major has really changed my outlook on our nation and I am happy to say SUNY Orange was the first one to teach me that. Coming out of SUNY Orange I will be taking with me, what we Exercise Science students call KSA's (knowledge, skills and abilities). With these knowledge, skills and abilities I have been accepted into a four-year program and feel as if I am ahead. SUNY Orange has not only prepared me for a higher level of college, but also taught me the meaning of responsibility and helped me grow as a smart young man. ",,Checked

At a very young age, I knew that becoming a veterinarian was what I wanted to do. This profession requires an extensive education, something that I have always valued more than any other aspect of life. I began my journey in the field of veterinary medicine during my Freshman year of high school by obtaining a position as a veterinary assistant at a local animal hospital. This experience confirmed that this is the job profession I was destined for.

   Upon graduating high school, I decided upon a non-traditional medium of furthering my education. For one year, I worked full time at Central Valley Animal Hospital. During this time, I learned a great deal: particularly, I learned that my profession of choice required a considerable amount of discipline, determination, and maturity. My employer, Dr. Carol Roshkind, taught me the basic professional skills necessary to continue my venture into veterinary medicine. Dr. Roshkind’s encouragement and guidance led me to realize that it was time to mature and begin my formal education, so that I could continue the process of becoming a veterinarian.

   In the Fall of 2012, I began my undergraduate education at SUNY Orange County Community College. At first, I was skeptical of the environment and wondered if this was truly the place to begin my studies. However, as the semester progressed, I came to value the education I was receiving. My professors were extremely intelligent and dedicated, qualities which greatly aided in my learning process. In the following Spring semester, I began taking my foundational science courses. I learned that SUNY Orange had a very strong science curriculum. My classes provided me with a substantial basis of scientific knowledge. This May 2014, I am expected to graduate with an Associate in Science in Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Obtaining this degree will mean that I will possess a foundation of knowledge and maturity that would allow me to succeed at a four-year university. 

   During my education so far, I have used the proficiency that I have obtained from SUNY Orange to excel in the courses that I have taken. SUNY Orange has adequately prepared me for the challenges that a four-year university would offer through the balance of my coursework, active work schedule, and community involvement. Given my educational background from SUNY Orange and my experience in veterinary medicine, finding a niche within the natural sciences will be made simple. With that, I will be forever grateful for the exceptional educational and professional preparation that SUNY Orange has provided.",,Checked

","SUNY Orange has provided an outstanding amount of education needs throughout the duration of the credits I have earned and those I intend to earn. Their campus locations have made my learning experience obtainable and convenient. The faculty and staff of SUNY Orange have provided me with the knowledge I need for future courses at a four year institution. In addition, the learning environment at SUNY Orange has helped me to fully understand the lessons I have been taught and has provided me with the encouragement and motivation needed to more forward with my career choice. With the knowledge I have obtained from SUNY Orange I believe I have a solid foundation of education and structure to move forward towards a higher degree, where I will challenge myself to the long hours of work I have ahead. My time at SUNY Orange has certainly showed me that you truly do get what you put in. The teaching staff at the college is excellent and they do their best to work with those who are willing to put in the extra effort. I learned quickly that the more time I spent in the library, or visiting a teacher during office hours, the better the grade at the end of the semester or on an exam. These qualities, which I have discovered through the help of SUNY Orange, I plan to take with me to whichever school I choose in which they will be extremely helpful in fulfilling my goals and dreams of one day being a physical therapist.

My first semester at SUNY Orange I was dealing with a lot of health problems that always had me down and depressed. These problems prevented me from being able to start college at a four year university, so I was upset when all my friends got to go away to school. However, when I got into the middle of the semester and started making friends from the softball team, my attitude started to change. I started to realize how encouraging the teachers were and how they really want every student to succeed. My first semester I got a job lifeguarding, which is what I love to do. I learned how to be independent, hardworking and well-rounded. I learned set backs can be turned into comebacks. I learned how to manage my time because pulling all nighters to get papers done is not fun. I learned that just because it's not a four year school doesn't mean you can't make great friends. I have learned so much from my professors and want to go on to be the best I can be. I learned how to balance school, softball, work and home duties. Most of all, I have learned that everyone has problems in life and being a nice person can really go a long way. SUNY Orange has taught me that you can do anything you put your mind too. I remember being terrified to take Capstone as a class and having to present not only in front of other students but my professors! Its crazy to me to think I already completed it, and not only did I survive but I was so proud of what my other classmates and I accomplished. Now at the end of this semester I will already be graduating and moving on to another school to get a bachelors and then master degree. I'm only 19 years old and I'm going to have an associate degree in a field I love, what more could I ask for.","Faculty Annual Scholarships

","My education has SUNY Orange has been very fulfilling. I am currently dual enrolled in CIT-Networking and Cyber Security and both of these programs have helped me become a better programmer. For instance, while taking CIT-Networking I took Computer Science 1 which enabled me to understand the core of many programming language. The class helped me in my day to day programming in areas such as code optimization; proper data type assignments and correct usage of control structures. Furthermore, taking this class made me realize just how much I love to program and that if I continue on with this career path I would be very well compensated for all my hard work. In addition to what I learned in Computer Science 1, another outstanding experience I have had is from the opportunities that have arrived from the education I received while at SUNY Orange. Without my programming and database knowledge I would have never been able to create the useful applications that I have at the Financial Aid office. As well as all the new opportunities that I have to work on even more projects such as Scholarship Interface and personal non for profit websites. As well the education and the work standpoint of my life SUNY Orange has also helped me in my personal life as well. In the fall semester of 2013 I was invited to join ECCEL a program to help inspire leadership in Community College students. The connections I have made through this program are absolutely life altering and the people I have met make life a lot more enjoyable. In the end SUNY Orange has not only prepared me for my career but also helped me grow spiritually and mentally.",,Checked
