  To Whom It May Concern,      

 As a Social Studies teacher at Newburgh Free Academy, it is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Jahimara Meraz.  I had the opportunity and pleasure to teach Jahimara in both Global Studies and Geography II Honors and AP Psychology.         Jahimara’s attitude regarding academics convinces me that she will be successful working under even the most demanding of course loads. Jahimara always views difficult assignments as a challenge, not simply a chore to be completed for a grade.  Her essays are always well written and insightful.  She never merely answers the question; she evaluates the topic and many times makes me think of something from a different perspective.  

     After observing Jahimara’s efforts in the classroom, I can decidedly say that she will have a positive effect on any institution she chooses to attend.  Her work ethic and kind and caring demeanor will serve both Jahimara and the school she chooses very well.        									    
Sincerely,

She not only completed each assignment, but she always made corrections to her work to fix any mistakes. During the school year Cassie was an active participant in class discussions, as well as a leader in the class; she accepted the responsibility of helping other students seated next to her in class. In a class of talented and bright students, Cassie excelled. Her achievement in the class and on the New York State Regents Exam in Algebra 2/Trigonometry enabled her to be placed in an honors mathematics class for her junior year and now in her senior year she is taking a calculus class at the local community college.

In addition to knowing Cassie as a student, I have had the pleasure of coaching her on the varsity volleyball team here at Minisink Valley for the past three years. Cassie was a captain of the team this past year, and her leadership on the team was invaluable. She organized the team’s work schedule and she made sure that the equipment was taken care of before and after each practice and game. What impressed me most about Cassie is her strong work ethic. Cassie worked her hardest during every practice session with the team to improve her volleyball skills. Cassie’s dedication to her self-improvement is outstanding. Cassie works on her athletic skills outside of the school volleyball season as well. She was an active member of USA Volleyball for many years and she played on a travel volleyball team that competed at weekend tournaments against teams from the east coast. The experiences that she has had through these competitions have given Cassie the maturity and confidence that many high school students lack. Cassie also has the ability to support the other members of the team during practices and games with her encouragement. I can always hear Cassie talking to the other players during volleyball drills, giving them bits of encouragement and praise. The same happens in volleyball matches as well. Cassie’s sportsmanship demonstrates her excellence of character. Cassie demonstrates responsibility and respect each day. She is polite and good-natured and she treats other people with honesty and kindness. Cassie is a leader; she accepts the responsibility of helping other people, both on the volleyball court and in the classroom. Cassie always has a positive attitude which makes it a pleasure to work with her.

I had the pleasure of being Brianna Simpsons’s Living Environment teacher during the 2011-2012 school year.  I got to know Brianna quite well seeing her an average of 1.5 times per day due to double lab days every other day. 
    Brianna is an extremely motivated student. I give students very lengthy comprehensive review packets for upcoming tests.  These optional review packets often contain one hundred plus past Regents exam questions.   Brianna regularly attended optional after school review sessions until she correctly answered every single question of every review packet.  Less than 5 percent of my students demonstrate such academic enterprise. Brianna’s attendance was truly exemplary.  She was very rarely out of school.  Finally, my records indicate that Brianna never missed a single assignment, nor was any assignment ever turned in late.  
     Brianna consistently grasped challenging, complex, and abstract concepts with minimal effort.  In terms of sheer intellectual capacity I rank Brianna somewhere between the top five and top ten percent of students.     I firmly believe she has the cognitive ability to become a successful nurse, a future field of choice she is strongly considering.   
Brianna works equally well independently or as part of a group.  She often took the initiative and demonstrated her leadership potential in keeping her lab partners on task or refocusing her group if their attention wavered.  In addition, she showed superior resourcefulness and used class ‘down time’ to get ahead of her assignments rather than goof around with classmates.  Furthermore, Brianna unfailingly participated in class discussions.  An enthusiastically waving hand was the norm.  Aside from simply answering class discussion questions, Brianna possessed intense intellectual curiosity.  She always wanted to know ‘Why?’ and ‘What if?’ and ‘Is it possible for…?’, etc.  
     Middletown High School is a socio-economically challenged district that often has significant disciplinary issues.  Brianna is mature beyond her years and was never in any way a discipline problem nor does she associate with trouble makers.   Unfortunately, many students at Middletown have never learned the importance of good manners.  Brianna was unwaveringly polite and always said: hello, goodbye, thank you, please, etc.   Her grasp of the importance of manners will serve her well in whatever field she chooses.
Brianna possesses many wonderful qualities.  However, it is her absolutely incredible personality however, that truly sets her apart from her peers.  She is one of the nicest, most polite, positive, happy students I have ever had the pleasure of having.  I don’t think I have ever seen her in a bad mood.  She has the natural ability to brighten a teacher’s day.  Every teacher I have ever spoken to regarding Brianna raves about her wonderful disposition.  To this day whenever I see Brianna she always has a big infectious smile. In terms of genuine friendliness and social skills she is truly exceptional.
   I have no doubt that when you combine Brianna’s motivation, intelligence, intellectual curiosity, maturity and wonderful personality, she will make an excellent addition to your school.

Academically, Kevin has maintained an impressive 93% GPA and High Honor Roll status throughout high school despite taking a challenging college preparatory curriculum including multiple Honors, AP, or College courses each year.  Kevin has been on an advanced track for Math and Science since 8th grade.   As a senior, Kevin has continued to challenge himself in the classroom by taking a full course load that includes College English, Calculus I, Biology, and Spanish.  Kevin is on pace to graduate in June with an Advanced Regents Diploma and his state and standardized test scores further illustrate his academic ability.  Although Kevin is an intelligent young man, he also is a hard-worker.  He is a mature, self-motivated and responsible student.  He understands the value of his education and has found success in the most difficult courses available.  Kevin has proven he is well prepared the next level of his education.

Outside of the classroom, Kevin has also distinguished himself as an active member of his school and community.  Kevin is a member of Key Club and F.B.L.A. (Future Business Leaders of America).  Both organizations are active in community service and fundraising events.  Kevin is a positive role model for fellow members because he can always be counted on to give his best effort at these events.  He has the self-confidence to do what he knows is right and not be swayed by popular opinion.  Kevin is a supportive and trustworthy friend.  His strong character has earned the respect of peers and faculty alike.

Kevin has always been a strong Math and Science student.  He has developed a genuine enjoyment for working with numbers and is planning to pursue a major in Accounting.  Although Kevin has the ability to be successful in a wide variety of career fields, I think he has chosen a major that fits his skill set well.  I believe Kevin has a very bright future and I recommend him for scholarship consideration with confidence.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

To whom it may concern, 

I am writing this letter of recommendation on the behalf of Mr. Adam Sontag. I have had the pleasure of knowing Samantha since the fall of 2012, when I arrived at Minisink Valley Central School District as a Physical Education Teacher, Coach and Aquatics Director. Based upon my interactions with her I can speak thoroughly about her qualifications and give her an enthusiastic recommendation. 
 Samantha has had a positive influence on many programs at Minisink Valley. She has been a lifeguard, a knowledgeable swimming instructor as well as a very dependable student. As a Lifeguard and Swimming Instructor Samantha has excelled in her ability to educate those around her and maintain a safe environment at our aquatic facility. She was placed in situations that required communication skills, responsibility and professionalism and performed above any expectations. With her students in the pool Samantha is able to succeed in many challenging situations and teach valuable skills to our younger students.   
Samantha’s performance has been above exceptional. I know that given the opportunity she will be an incredible asset to any University. Please take the time to meet this outstanding young woman and you will see the qualities and attributes that lead me to say that she is one of Minisink Valleys best and brightest. Feel free to call me if you have any questions about Samantha Black or her qualifications

To Whom It May Concern:

I welcome the opportunity to write this letter of recommendation for Kaitlyn Kras, as I feel that she is a fine individual with tremendous promise.  I have had the pleasure of getting to know Kaitlyn this year as her guidance counselor.  In speaking with Kaitlyn and her teachers on many occasions, I feel confident in composing this letter on her behalf.  Kaitlyn is a kind and caring young lady who shines both personally and academically.

Kaitlyn works incredibly hard, earning solid grades in all of her courses.  She is also one of the most determined students that I have ever met.  Not one to take her high school education lightly, she has consistently enrolled in a challenging program, working hard and going above and beyond the requirements at Valley Central High School.   Understanding the need to take rigorous classes in high school in an effort to best prepare herself for a collegiate nursing program, Kaitlyn chose to take Advanced Biology, Advanced Earth Science, Chemistry, AP Biology, and Algebra II and Trigonometry. She is working hard and reaping the rewards of her efforts.  Kaitlyn is also a skilled artist and has challenged some of our most difficult art courses.  Her work is amazing. You should also know that Kaitlyn has a warm personality and a quick wit.  She is able to easily transition from one situation to the next and is not one to be pigeonholed into a particular category or group.  She is kind-hearted and sincere, both qualities necessary for nurses when dealing with individuals in vulnerable circumstances. She is truly a pleasure to be around.

Kaitlyn is a well-rounded individual with interests and strengths in so many areas.    She has won the admiration and respect of her teachers and peers, and she receives my enthusiastic recommendation.  Please contact me at (845) 457-2400 ext. 17611 with any of your questions or concerns.

As a public school teacher, I have encountered many students who due to lack of effort fail to realize their full potential.  It is far rarer to encounter a student who willfully exercises self-discipline and motivation in order to ensure that he or she produces the highest quality work and outcomes possible at all times. Anyone in search of the quintessential hardworking student should meet Matthew Crown. 

I had the pleasure of having Matt as a student in ninth grade and eleventh grade English. From day one, Matt’s sweet genuine smile and hard work ethic dominated the classroom experience. As a student he was always engaged in the classroom and worked to improve his writing on a daily basis. In addition to having Matt in class, I also tutored him last year to prepare for his English Regents. Matt is a person who is well aware of his strengths and weaknesses and he is fully willing to put in the extra time and effort to ensure success. It has been a pleasure to watch him grow as a person over the course of his high school years. Matt is truly a respectable young man. 

It is evident that Matt’s education is important to him but it is not the only area of his life where he has shown desire and dedication. Most weekends Matt can be found competing in the NEATV motocross racing series. When I asked Matt why he enjoyed motocross, I found his answer to perfectly reflect his personality. Matt enjoys dedicating his time to this sport because he loves the friendly and inviting atmosphere created by the participants. Matt views his motocross friends as a tight knit community. Matt clearly values his family and friends and recognizes what is important in life. Not only is Matt involved in motocross but he was also selected as a captain for this year’s football team. Matt is a young man who leads by example both on and off the field by working hard to achieve success. He is respectful, dependable, and willing to work for what he wants. I truly admire these qualities in this young man. 

It is for these reasons that I offer high recommendations for him without reservation. Due to his character and work ethic, Matt is completely deserving of a scholarship. If you have any questions regarding this recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

     I am writing to give my most enthusiastic recommendation for Michelle Manning, who would like to be considered for the SUNY Orange Scholarship.  I have known Michelle for several years and am quite confident that she will be one of your very best students and hygienists.  I first met Michelle when she enrolled in my cognitive psychology course, and she has since taken several courses with me, including my advanced human memory course.  Michelle excelled in every class!  She not only demonstrates a strong command of course material, but she was an active participant in every class, asked challenging and probing questions, and submitted outstanding papers and exams.  As a result of her stellar performance, I asked Michelle to work in my lab as a research assistant more than a year ago.  She is now in her fourth semester as a researcher, and I could not be happier with her performance.  Michelle is masterful with time management and collaboration with others.  She has teamed with several other undergraduates to develop experimental materials, learn a new computer program, recruit senior citizens for our research, and conduct experimental testing.  In each instance, her student colleagues have had only the most positive things to say about working with her.  In addition, the older adults who serve as volunteers all rave about her professionalism.  Michelle is adept in a variety of situations with diverse individuals, and these abilities will serve her well as health professional.
     Michelle is exceptional not only in these academic arenas, but in clinical settings as well.  In an effort to better ascertain her professional interests and ambitions, Michelle has taken advantage of a number of opportunities to interact with patients and gain experience.   Michelle has shadowed physician assistants, therapists, and dental hygienists.  She has traveled to remote areas within the United States and Central America to better understand health care needs and her personal strengths and goals. Notably, many of her experiences have involved serving underprivileged groups – from Native Americans living on a reservation to villagers in Ecuador.  In fact, it was through her recent trip with MEDLIFE that she developed a passion for the dental field.  I remember vividly her enthusiasm when she came into my office after her trip, and the excitement and joy she expressed in discussing how she had taken several dental rotations on the trip and she knew she had found her calling.  Michelle is the rare student who has the talent, the intellect, and the experience to hit the ground running and take off as a star student.
    Michelle’s story is particularly spectacular when you consider her background.  She is comes from a very small, rural town in Kentucky and is the first woman in her family to graduate from college.  You would never suspect such humble upbringings from a student as articulate, confident, and competent as Michelle.  I have watched her develop of the past several years, as I have taught her in several classes and worked closely with her in my lab.  I am on sabbatical this year and ordinarily would not supervise any students.  Michelle is so exceptional, however, that I agreed to supervise her Bachelor’s Essay – an intensive year-long project that involves a full scientific experiment and paper.  Michelle has already completed one full study and we have submitted the paper for publication.  She will present the work at two professional conferences this spring, and we are collaborating in designing a follow up project.  Our work has examined prospective memory, that is, the ability to remember to complete a task in the future (e.g., paying a bill, sending an email, taking medication).  Michelle’s work examined ways to increase prospective memory success while at the same time reducing repetition errors (e.g., paying a bill twice or overdosing medication).  Her work is meticulous, creative, and professional.   She has been a tremendous collaborator throughout her tenure in my lab, and I will have an enormous void to fill when she graduates.  I wish I could have convinced her to go into the field of experimental psychology, but alas she is following her passion. I hope that you give her your most serious consideration – I know she will be an absolute sensation in your program as she has been here.

It is with great pleasure that I submit this letter for Christine Roman, a former student in my 11th grade English course that met during the 2012-2013 school year. She is one of the best participators and people I have met in my twenty years here at Valley Central.
First and foremost, Christine Roman made a huge impact on me and my philosophy about life in general. On a daily basis she would regale our class with stories about funny experiences and how NOT to take life so seriously. In speaking with her, one is immediately at ease because she cares about what the other person is thinking and feeling. I will always remember that about her. She also has a great depth of knowledge in the application of critical thinking. Not one to let things go she takes the necessary steps in solving things. She is great to talk to.
In the classroom last year she performed above average with oral expression being her strong suit. She performed well on the state exam and completed assignments to the best of her ability. Another passion of hers is music. During our poetry unit she” enlightened” me with her preferences and how relevant songs applied to the world at large. Her group made a morph suit poetry project that was easily the best out of 75 students. She is a catalyst in the group dynamic and can make any situation better. She shows respect to everyone and in turn is respected. I was sad to see last year end.
Lastly, Christine Roman is a good person who knows how to overcome adversity. What you see is what you get. She never sells out to gossip and trends and treats people decently. If you were to ask her peers about her, I guarantee a favorable response. She is a people person who loves indiscriminately, but can take a stand and NOT be a pushover. It is my opinion that she has all the maturity and skills necessary for college. She sets reasonable goals and will amaze others as I have been amazed. She has GREAT parents and they will see her through.
Therefore, without hesitation, I strongly recommend her to you as a candidate for your prestigious institution. One simple letter does not do her justice.

It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Samantha Black who was a student in my US History class last year.  This class challenges students by analyzing primary sources, political cartoons, and graphs.  In addition to traditional testing, students have surprise quizzes on homework reading and are assigned three major research projects.  Writing effectively, current events, classroom discussion, and the use of logic are stressed.  Samantha successfully completed this class with an 85 average, including a 85 on the cumulative New York State Regents exam.
 
Samantha’s most outstanding characteristic is her good work ethic.  This is evidenced by the fact that she did not miss a homework assignment all year.  Sam demonstrated that she studied hard for exams as seen through her test scores.  She also came for some extra help before some tests.  Her projects were always well researched and detailed.   Samantha’s work ethic is what separates her from most of her peers.

Samantha exhibited other important qualities in my class.  Firstly, she was an above average writer.  Sam understands how to write a thesis and prove it with facts.  She was also excellent at analyzing political cartoons and primary sources.  Samantha participated in class by asking and answering questions.  Samantha was able to keep her grades up (High Honor Roll all three years) while working as a lifeguard and volunteering as a Study Buddy.   Lastly, Sam contributed to a positive classroom environment by being polite and participating in class discussions.  She was truly a pleasure to have in class.  

In conclusion, I recommend Samantha Black to any college admissions staff.  I believe she has the talents and ability to make any college she chooses to attend a better place.  If I can be of any further assistance in evaluating Samantha’s application, please contact me at the above address or you may e-mail me at esucich@minisink.com.

To Whom It May Concern:

It is with great pleasure and high regards that I attest to Kimberly Luciano’s character, work ethic and musicianship.  I have had the always demonstrated a high level of commitment: this year she could not fit band into her schedule but she elected to take an independent study in band to continue honing her skills and participate in the concerts.  Kim has participated in NYSSMA solo festivals each year since sixth grade and has received ratings of “Excellent” and “Outstanding.”  She has also been an active member of the school’s marching band and has participated in four parades and pep band throughout high school.  In college, Kim has a great interest in pursuing music and math and privilege of being Kim’s music teacher for four years.  Since the day I met her, she has demonstrated a high level of cooperation, enthusiasm and kindness.  She has been an active participant in the music program during her entire time at Chester Academy.  Kim has hopes to become an educator in either of these fields.  Her kindness, patience and compassion for others coupled with her academic achievement and diligence certainly emulate the qualities of a caring teacher.  She has always been eager to improve her skills on French Horn and has even studied guitar outside of school.  I could always count on her to attend lessons and practice routinely.

Outside of music, Kim has demonstrated strong work ethic and responsibility.  She has worked at McDonald’s for the last three years while maintaining high grades.  She has been a reliable worker and makes it a point to be on time for school, work and clubs.  

Kim’s character is both admirable and commendable.  She continues to make me proud with her dedication and desire to learn.  She has been a respectful student and also respects her peers.  I am confident that she will continue to demonstrate a solid work ethic and will put forth her best effort and enthusiasm as she begins her college experience with a goal of being a future educator.  I offer her my highest recommendation.

I feel like her transcript does not do her justice. She had some issues adjusting to high school in the beginning. These issues impacted her academics the most. In reviewing her transcript, you can clearly see when the turned around started to take place. She grew and matured as a student and a young woman. I truly believe that the work that she is currently doing is a much better representation of what she is capable of rather than her earlier years. I am confident that she can be successful in a college classroom.

 Ally has to be one of the most kind and caring students that I have had the honor of working with as a counselor. One of the greatest examples of this is when she pitched in to help one of our local families after a horrible tragedy. During 11th grade, Ally was struggling with two of her courses so she asked for help. She started being tutored by one of Minisink's former graduates. He inspired her to do well in school and helped her gain the confidence that she could do so. It worked! Unfortunately, this young man was killed in a horrible car accident. Ally was devastated. She put her grief into action and organized a fundraiser for the family without even being asked. She has a heart of gold. She uses the confidence that this young man had in her to help to accomplish the goals that she has established for herself. Ally is prepared to attend college in the fall. She will work hard and do whatever necessary to earn a college degree. I am so proud of the student that she has developed into and the young woman that she has come to be. I am hoping that she can be considered for some of scholarship opportunities that SUNY Orange offers. She is a very deserving young woman.

I have known Michelle for three years, as I have been the professor of her Introduction to Psychological Science, Psychological Statistics and Abnormal Psychology courses.  She has also completed several other courses in our department, including Developmental Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience, Personality, and Industrial/Organizational Psychology.  Michelle was a pleasure to have in my classes.  

Throughout the courses that I taught, Michelle demonstrated an ability to work both independently and as part of a team.  Part of her coursework for Abnormal Psychology involved a collective presentation on a specific disorder, and Michelle performed extremely well at this task.  She was engaging as a speaker and always had thoughtful questions during lecture.  

On a personal level, Michelle is gregarious and full of life.  She is truly passionate about her college career, and takes her studies very seriously.  Michelle has my highest recommendation.  Please feel free to contact me if I can be of further assistance.

I enjoyed being able to see how much he has grown as a student in a single year,  as Junior in high school it is usual for a student to display the level of academic integrity and dedication which is required for our College Biology program.  Connor is grade conscious and determined to understand the material at the mastery level. If I had to sum up Connor as a student I would call him engrossed in the learning process. 

Socially, Connor is well respected and a motivator to his peers. Mr. Rhodes is able to foster a classroom climate that encourages interesting questions, free thinking, as well as a higher level of education which is crucial in post-secondary education.

I am writing this letter on behalf of Amber Saunders, a student in my College English class this year.  I have known Amber since September 2013, and I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation.  

Amber is a talented and diligent student.  She is well-organized and functions in a conscientious manner under pressure.  She works well with others and is a supportive partner when working with a group.  Amber is both inquisitive and eager to share her views regarding course material.  Although she appears reserved at first, she distinguishes herself through her enthusiastic and friendly nature.  I have been most impressed with Amber’s leadership in fostering a community within the classroom.  She will take on responsibilities – both in class and outside of class – that allow activities to run more smoothly.  In class, Amber is a student on whom teachers can depend for constructive contributions on a daily basis.

Amber is a respectful, sincere, and level-headed young woman who is not easily influenced by others.  Her potential for growth is enhanced by her leadership abilities and her kindness.

Throughout her high school career, Amber has worked to earn her current position as the student leader of our school’s JROTC organization.  On a daily basis, Amber fulfills the responsibilities of this position with grace and a cheerful disposition.  She sets a positive example for fellow students, delegates responsibilities among the other student leaders, serves as a representative for our school’s program, and leads the daily operations of the organization.

     For the past three years, I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Joseph Lubrano as a student in my Regents Living Environment and Honors Regents Chemistry classes.  I have been a full-time tenured science teacher at Newburgh Free Academy for the past fourteen years and teach multiple disciplines at the high school.  I have taught Regents Biology, Regents Chemistry, and a college level Forensic Science Course affiliated with Mercy College.  For the past fifteen years, I have been a part-time adjunct professor at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York and teach a Biology Course.  
          
     During the 2011-2012, school year, Joseph was a student in my Regents Living Environment class and he is presently in my Honors Chemistry Course.  Joseph is a mature, punctual, and motivated student who has shown exceptional study skills and initiative in both courses.  He is a quiet, determined student who enjoys learning.  In both courses, Joseph has shown exceptional listening skills and critical thinking skills. Joseph has displayed professionalism during his oral presentations in Honors Chemistry. Honors Chemistry contains a very demanding science curriculum with difficult concepts. Joseph successfully completed the Regents Living Environment Course with a 94 average and presently has achieved 97 in a challenging Honors Regents Chemistry course.  Joseph is not only an outstanding student, but also he is a great help to other students who have difficulty understanding.  He has displayed outstanding leadership, teamwork, and organizational skills during the laboratory experiments in both Living Environment and Honors Chemistry.  Joseph has often offered to assist me in distributing lab supplies and ensuring that all lab supplies are returned.

     Joseph is personable with many friends outside of class.  Joseph has been able to maintain a high scholastic average and participate in the varsity lacrosse team over the past three years.  He is an active member of the National Honor Society and New York State Science Honor Society.  He has participated in the annual Making Strides for Breast Cancer Walk at Woodbury Commons.

     Joseph always has a beautiful smile and pleasant personality, which matches his continual effort for success in his academics.  Joseph is the most honest, respectful, intelligent, organized and positive student I have worked with over many years.   It is an honor to recommend Joseph Lubrano for the Presidential Scholarship at Orange County Community College.  Joseph is an exceptional student that a teacher will miss, when he graduates.  With his outstanding study habits, intellectual prowess, determination and enthusiasm for learning, I know that Joseph will succeed in his educational goals and make Orange County Community College proud of their choice.

In my many years of teaching high school mathematics, I rarely have a student as committed and successful as Joseph.  His positive demeanor and work ethic in my Integrated Algebra course in the 2011-2012 school year was an inspiration to his peers and myself.  With grades consistently in the high 90’s, Joseph was not just an academic leader but also a student leader.  I often observed Joseph providing tutoring to his fellow students and was always extremely gracious and supportive to them.  Joseph is not a person content with simply observing.  Time and time again Joseph would provide input to class discussions that generated input from other students creating an improved academic forum.  
	Joseph has also proven himself to be a leader as captain of the Lacrosse team.  He is also an active member of the National Honor Society and Science Honor Society.  Joseph also participated in school activities and charitable events.  Joseph’s aspirations of becoming a Structural Engineer are well within his ability to accomplish.
Based on my observations I believe Joseph to possess the perseverance and capability to handle his academic curricula.  I believe you will find in Joseph a worthy student and a fine representative for your institution.

As a young art student, she excelled in project assignments. She demonstrated a keen sense of creating aesthetically pleasing work while having advanced skill in drawing and painting. In fact, Ashley enrolled in an advanced art class in 8th grade which allowed her to take a sophomore level drawing and painting class as a freshman in high school. She is not only a hard-working individual, but a true creative thinker; one who inspires others to create and express themselves visually. 
In a small district, Ashley stands out against a backdrop of other art students. Her middle school art teacher, Andrew Latini, can remember her as well amongst his students, always putting her best into every assignment and taking projects “to the next level”. Ashley has a strong sense of artistic ability. She studies her craft and is always trying to be a better artist. Since I have known her, I’ve watched her mature as an artist enthusiastically and always rise above project expectations.
In her first full year course at Chester Academy she began to develop a personal voice in her art while strengthening her drawing and painting skills. She worked in pencil, color pencil and acrylic paint and created self-portraits, still-life drawings, cartoons and non-objective works. These fundamental skills in drawing transferred into her passion-graphic design and illustration. As a sophomore, she took her knowledge of 2-D art into a 3-dimensional realm in a half year elective course entitled Ceramics and Sculpture. She was very good at envisioning the sculpture in its’ final form and knowing how to execute to create it. This year, she continues to develop her own ideas and thoughts visually in a full year independent study/portfolio development course. Only instructor chosen students are allowed to take this full year course and the expectation is for the student to self-guide their artwork, as I facilitate. Ashley has been highly successful in this course with a current average of  90%. Throughout her high school career she has built a strong portfolio for college admission through her determination to always better herself as a student and artist and also work on her “own art” outside of classroom assignments.
I always see her, sketches in hand, thoroughly thinking through her art before she creates it. She has plans to further her studies at the collegiate level and pursue a career in the visual arts and I highly recommend her for any course of study or employment opportunity in these areas. She has a promising future and I have no doubt she will make positive contributions to her community and society at large creatively.

Re:  Allyson Andryshak
To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter on behalf of Allyson Andryshak, a student in my College English class this year.  I have known Allyson since September 2013, and it is with great pleasure and pride that I write this letter of recommendation.

Allyson is a highly talented and diligent student.  Her coursework is important to her, and she approaches it both thoughtfully and purposefully.  In class, it quickly became evident that Allyson’s work ethic and positive attitude contribute to her success.  She often seeks opportunities outside of class to meet with me regarding her writing, and she has even submitted one of her essays for publication by an outside organization.  Allyson is dedicated to the pursuit of excellence even when it involves a major commitment to work and study, as evidenced by her participation in the Community College in the High School program and by her outstanding performance throughout high school.  

Personally, Allyson is well-liked and highly respected both by her peers and by the faculty.  She has an affable manner and participates in a variety of school activities, most notably as an active member of our school’s Drama Club.  Additionally, this year Allyson is the “Voice of the Valley,” the student volunteer who recites the Pledge of Allegiance and reads the daily announcements via the PA system every morning. Throughout her high school career, Allyson has distinguished herself from her peers through her genuine love of service, regardless of whether she receives recognition for her deeds.  She is one of the most compassionate and polite students I have met in my 12 years of teaching.  Allyson will thrive in the college setting because of her thoughtful nature, strong work ethic, and eagerness to participate in an active learning community.

In summary, it is without hesitation that I recommend Allyson Andryshak for the SUNY Orange President’s Scholarship, or any other scholarship opportunities for which she is eligible.  I am confident that she will be successful in her academic pursuits, and she will make important contributions to the academic program and the SUNY Orange campus community.

Cinthia is an intelligent, young woman who approached her studies with maturity and integrity. I have rarely taught a student who could match Cinthia’s sweet, polite disposition.

AP level courses can be intimidating for many students, but Cinthia persevered and made solid progress with her critical writing skills.

She was successful in an AP level course because of her natural intelligence, her great work ethic, and her consistent perseverance.  She is such a humble human being who is both compassionate and responsible.  I can not think of many students who are as deserving as Cinthia.  I wish her the very best in all her pursuits.  She was a complete pleasure to teach and I know she will continue to grow and prosper in college.

Dear Scholarship Selection Committee:

I am writing on behalf of Erin Johnson as a candidate for the incoming freshman scholarships available at SUNY Orange.  She is an intelligent, capable, and motivated young woman who deserves every consideration for any scholarships you might offer.

Erin currently ranks 127 in her graduating class of 356 with a 7th semester GPA of 88.0962.  She has taken a full college prep program and is well prepared to transition to full time college study.  Erin transferred to us from a small private school in grade 9 and made a strong adjustment to the courses and schedule we offer.  She is held in high regard by her teachers as a responsible and respectful student.  She can always be counted on to contribute positively to class discussions and projects.

Most of Erin’s co-curricular activities have been outside of school. She is an active member of her church youth group where she participates in social and community service activities.  She loves to sing and performed at school and in the community when she was younger.  Erin takes her responsibilities seriously, manages her time well, and her values are without question.  Erin lives with her mother who is divorced, in addition to her grandparents.  The unique opportunity this has given her to live multi-generationally has impacted her in a positive way.  Her insights are mature beyond her youth and she has always been organized, focused, and driven to do her best.  Erin is certainly a young woman who will continue to be a positive force in this world.

Therefore it is with confidence that I recommend Erin to you and welcome any inquiries on her behalf.  Should you have any further questions or concerns, please contact me at (845) 497-4000 x24515.

I have known Tiffany Schoonmaker for the past three years.  Tiffany has been a student in both my high school and college level accounting courses, as well as, a member of the Pine Bush High School Academy of Finance (AOF), which I direct.

Tiffany is a delightful young woman.  She comes to class eager to learn every day.  She is quite intelligent and a diligent worker.  When Tiffany was in Accounting I, she excelled in the course.  She came to class each day eager to learn; her work was always complete and checked for accuracy.  Tiffany worked well in groups and could often be found in the position of team leader.  Her grasp of material was evident in her near 100% grade.  Tiffany consistently helped others in the class and was seen as a role model among her peers.

Currently, Tiffany is enrolled in Financial Accounting, which is offered through SUNY Orange.   
Ms. Schoonmaker continues to excel in accounting.  She is able to complete all assignments within the allotted time frame.   Tiffany grasps complex material with ease and has achieved excellent grades on all exams.  Currently, she is involved in a group project and is doing very well.  I have observed Tiffany taking on a leadership role within her group.  

As an AOF student, Tiffany had to participate in a paid summer internship.  Tiffany applied, interviewed, and received an internship at Hudson Heritage Federal Credit Union (HHFCU).  This was the first time that this particular organization had afforded the AOF an internship position.  I chose Tiffany because I knew that she was organized, responsible, and intelligent.  Due to her excellent performance at HHFCU, they will be offering us internship positions for next summer.  

Tiffany Schoonmaker is a hard-working, dedicated, responsible, and ambitious young woman.  She is consistently on high honor roll and is a current member of our National Honor Society.  Tiffany would make a wonderful candidate for SUNY Orange’s Presidential Scholarship.  It is with great pleasure that I recommend Ms. Tiffany Schoonmaker for this and all her future endeavors.  SUNY Orange would be quite fortunate to have a student like Tiffany Schoonmaker on their campus.

I am very pleased to recommend Ryan Lowe for your scholarship. I have known Ryan for two years.  I first met him when he was in my eleventh grade Algebra 2 math class. Throughout the course of the year, Ryan distinguished himself as an outstanding math student. During the time that Ryan spent in my class, he consistently gave me his full attention and enjoyed learning. He is able to explain his solutions to problems accurately and clearly. Ryan is a very consistent student. He earned very high marks throughout the year, amongst the top in my class.

This year, I am again pleased to report, having spoken to his Trigonometry teacher, that Ryan continues his commitment to excel in math. Ryan is an excellent role model for students. His positive attitude and good nature bring much to a class.

Ryan is considerate, and thoughtful. His work demonstrates that he is mature and well rounded. Under his quiet nature, he is a positive upbeat student. He is always friendly towards students and staff.

Ryan’s hard work and ability make him especially well suited to attend college. I feel that Ryan will be a successful student at the college level. He has the ability to perform well academically. He also has the maturity to cope with all the challenges college will offer. I am very pleased to recommend him for your scholarship.

He plans to continue to give back to his community by maintaining his service to his local fire department and to advance his training once he turns 18. 

As a professional goal, Ryan has long dreamed of becoming an Architect. When he learned about the C.A.D. program at Orange-Ulster BOCES during his sophomore year in high school, Ryan worked closely with me to align his academic plan to achieve this goal. He is a top achieving student in his BOCES program and his experience there has reaffirmed his desire to continue in the field of architecture. 

It is my belief that Ryan is a very deserving student for your scholarship. He has shown consistent dedication to his academic pursuits and will strive to no only meet, but exceed his personal goals. It is with my highest endorsement that I present his candidacy for this award. ",Checked

	Bryon is also a very personable young man.  He is well liked by both teachers and peers, and has a good sense of humor.  He is also very quick to help another student who needs it.  He really enjoys music and drama and even though those interests take up a lot of his time, he always manages to keep up his academics.
