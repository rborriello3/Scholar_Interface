","        In high school, my favorite classes were adolescent phycology and health. I plan to study human services in collage to help prepare myself to become a counselor. Ever since I can remember I have always enjoyed helping, listening and giving guidance to others. Also the well being of the human body and maintaining it healthy has been my interest. Helping and working with others to achieve a healthy state mentally and physically is one my professional long term goals
        Through the years I have had many personal struggles of my own. Such as depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. I myself have seen a counselor and to this day continue to see one. All I can say Is that counselors can make a real difference in a persons life. In my own experience a counselor  has changed my life. Through my own personal struggles and challenges my counselor has always advised me and listened to me when I needed it the most. I know I can always find support with my counselor when I can not find it any where else.
          My passion in helping family, friends and others has grown over the years. As I overcame my own personal struggles and challenges I have learned many important life skills. Life skills that I hope to share with others, to help them overcome their own personal struggles. I am excited to start collage and study human services. This program can help me find new ways to support others emotionally, physically and mentally. My goals are to become well educated and pursue a great, enjoyable career in counseling.   ",,Checked

Ever since I was small I always loved cartoons and always wanted to make my own one day.  Fortunately I was born with a very overactive imagination and the ability to express it both visually and verbally.  Soon after it became my goal, I have decided I want to bring some of my ideas to a television screen.
	I started out as just that kid in school that doodles on his paper through every class just because of the boredom, but I did have a talent for writing. Coming up with stories was a specialty of mine especially, when I forgot my homework. Then I went to my first school art class. However, being a man with very low self-esteem, I did not think my little doodles were as good as everyone else’s, but my art teacher Mr. Hoover told me otherwise. Even though my art may not be the greatest of the whole class, it definitely was more imaginative.  I was one of his favorite students and I went to him on my own time, so he could teach me skills I could use later on.
	Moving this essay to English for a minute, as English was one of my better subjects. I was one for the art of words, as my essays were always wowing the teachers and keeping my grades in the 90’s, not to mention the poems and haikus as well.  In fact there was one poem in particular those teachers still talk about and that poem is one I wrote back in middle school about how awful middle school was (ironic isn’t it?).  I remember comparing school, not to a summer’s breeze, but to Alcatraz, even though I’m sure a prison has much more tasteful lunch food. 
	Now around the time I reached high school during my junior year I signed up to go to BOCES CTEC to get education in Advertising Art and Design, since animation was unfortunately not part of their program. I needed to get some type of computer drawing and animation under my belt to get a leg up on other graduates, attempting to get into college for the same career as me.  Over my two years there I have made and produced dozens of works and made a huge portfolio to show them off.  I do believe my personal favorite work was my first year project of creating a children’s cookbook character who became a banana man who used a lighter that popped out the bottom of his person to cook pancakes for all the children.  
That being said in conclusion I have an imagination that very few people are born with and over the course of my life I have dedicated myself to a dream I will fight for.  And I have proven to myself and my peers that I have a talent of my very own that will define who I am and what I will be.  And soon the world will see my worlds and my visions and it will make me one happy guy.
I feel I deserve this scholarship due to my own abilities to overcome the hardships I have had to face. My social disorder made it very difficult for me in school both with my peers and the atmosphere and I feel that I have accomplished the best that I could while trying to cope with this. My parents have fallen on hardships due to the economy and they do the best and want the best for me. If I am granted this scholarship, I will use it towards my tuition, books, art supplies and necessary computer programs to attain my life goal.

I am a well- rounded student.  Although my transcripts attest to how smart I am it does not illuminate the entire picture.  I am able to acquire new material with ease.  Throughout the years of schooling not only did I learn the material being taught, I was able to develop an understanding of how to internalizes information and become an independent student.  

I feel my achievements and statistics are impressive. But any candidate can look good on paper.  What cannot be expressed on a transcript or resume is the impact a person leaves on the people around them.  Our school was in utter turmoil over the Christmas season this year,   as a leader among my peers, many of them turned to me for guidance and reassurance.  Despite my own grief, I organized several activities such as an indoor soccer tournament, snow-tubing, movies, and dinners to help with the sudden loss.  My goal was to make sure that the entire family felt the love and support of the students of Goshen High School.

I crave challenges.  The more difficult the situation, the more determined and focused I become is to find a solution.  With the right guidance and direction, there is no limit as to what I can achieve.   I know given the right opportunities my academic and professional goals will be achieved.  This will take hard work and determination, which I am willing to do.  This next journey will be one of great importance to my future and who I will become.  Thank you for your consideration.

My high school doors are closing as my college path awaits. My confidence in my academic abilities has never wavered. I have and will continue to strive for success.

Throughout my school years I have always maintained the desire and need to succeed academically. This is evidenced by my GPA along with my honor roll awards received. I am currently a senior at Middletown High School. I also attend a vocational school, Orange Ulster BOCES where I am enrolled in the Allied Health Medical Assistant program. The BOCES program is a two year curriculum which is not only classroom learning but field study, including clinical rotations at our local hospital, Crystal Run buildings, Park Manor, and the Special Education building at BOCES. The hands on experience has been invaluable. Upon completion of my vocational program I will be a certified medical assistant. The program has given me the aspiration to continue my education in the healthcare field. I plan to attend college full-time to become a registered nurse which I not only see as a job or career but an adventure. Nursing is a very rewarding profession financially but also emotionally as nurses can make a difference in someone's life. 

There is so much to learn and I am eager to learn it. I accept and look forward to the challenges that are before me. I know that with the knowledge I possess along with a college education, I will be that nurse that makes a difference.  

My parents’ have always supported me throughout my school years however they are unable to financially support my college career. I hope you find that I am a worthy recipient of this scholarship award as I will be relying on scholarships to fund my tuition along with financial aid and student loans. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Relay for Life ","Since I began school thirteen years ago, I have always envisioned myself attending SUNY Orange.  As my mother and I walked through the campus on the way to kindergarten at Truman Moon Elementary school, I admired the beautiful mansion and the students rushing to class, hoping that someday it would be me.  (Not to mention, I live only three blocks from the campus).
	My interest in SUNY Orange increased with my participation in “An Artist’s Response to Human Rights” art exhibit, as well as my recognition in the Sojourner Truth Awards ceremony.  I am particularly impressed by SUNY Orange’s strong support of human rights, and I look forward to pursuing this passion through my art as a college student.
	I take my academics very seriously and therefore work extremely hard to perform to the best of my ability.  My hard work has been rewarded by a high level of academic success and an opportunity to take a variety of AP and college courses at Middletown High School.  I excel in art, biology, and English.  Since I have done well in high school, I do have a variety of options for college.  I have already been accepted to several four-year schools should I choose to go away freshman year.  However, SUNY Orange remains to be my first choice.  After reviewing the courses offered at SUNY Orange I am confident that I will be appropriately challenged and well prepared to transfer to the four-year school of my choice.
	Like any other high school student, I am still deciding what will ultimately be my career, but I do hope to double major in Fine Art and Liberal Arts: Mathematics and Natural Science.   Currently in high school, I have taken two years of college-level science courses, and I am currently taking AP studio art.  The careers I am interested in the art field are within the film industry, mostly in animation, or possibly even set design.  The computer animation class I took in high school sparked my interest in animated and live-action movies.  Any art course I take will be useful in films or other related media, which I am highly interested in.  In science, my main career choice would be anything in the biomedical field.  I have always found the human body interesting, so any job here would be perfect for me.
	I look forward to walking through the campus as a SUNY Orange student in the fall of 2014.  I will be the SUNY Orange student that I had dreamed of being for so many years.  A Presidential Scholarship will certainly help make all of this possible.

During this time I have had the opportunity to serve the community by participating in fund raising events such as the American Heart Walk, raising over $2,000 for a local teen who had a heart transplant, and annually dropping off Christmas cards at the local nursing home.

Growing up on a farm gave me clear insight into the delicate balance of how to care for our environment and use everything wisely.  Waste was eliminated from everything including what I ate to how energy was consumed the home.  There was a clear sense of responsibility and commitment to the animals by knowing they needed to be cared for no matter how lousy I felt on a particular day.  This experience has helped me to be a responsible and honest person who cares about the need to help improve the life of others.

After graduation I would like to serve our community by either joining the local police force or to continue my education and career with the Air Force.   Either of these fields after graduation would be of utmost importance to my future.  Part of my professional goal would be to continue volunteering.  Being able to experience other cultures would expand my knowledge of other communities and allow better communication.

","           Ever since I was eight, I wanted to pursue a career in teaching. The realization first came to me while playing school with my sister; she was the aid; I, of course, was the teacher. We would hold classes on a daily basis with our stuffed animals, and faithfully graded their papers. This pastime was a foreshadowing of what was to lie ahead later in life. 
           As I grew up, I wanted to be an English teacher but that soon fell from the plan; I was not any good at it. Although, I loved to read, English had too many rules. I felt that all the rules contradicted each other, making math my obvious choice. Math became my passion. I always loved the simplicity of it. There are rules, and you follow those rules to get from point A to point B. I always excelled in my math classes, making me the “go-to person” in class. I have the ability to teach others what I know and help them “figure it out”. Instead of teaching stuffed animals, the students are real and I love it. The enjoyment I feel from helping others nourishes my need to pursue a career in education. 
           At age 13, I did not know how to read music, nor did I know how to play it. Nevertheless, that did not deter me. I joined the Chester Middle School Band. I really aspired to be a flutist, but the only instrument left was the French horn. This well-rounded brass instrument surely started my music career. Although, the French horn was weird looking it made me feel like the most unique musician in the whole band. Years of practice and making friends with another student who played the same instrument, has made me a better-developed player. Although she was two years younger than I was, she became my mentor. She made me strive to become a better musician. While I may not be the greatest French horn player in the band, I am certainly much closer to that goal than I dreamed I would be.
Now that I am a senior in high school, this ideal career goal has become more realistic. Although I am afraid of what lies ahead, I am glad to say that the years leading up to this moment has confirmed my desire to teach. I forever want to be the best math/music teacher that anyone has ever known.

You are always asked those staggering questions,” What do you plan on doing when you grow up?” The cliché answer for every kid is astronaut or doctor. I always wanted to be an English teacher, which is astonishing because writing is not my strongest suit. However, the beauty of growing up is that changes are expected and almost mandatory. Although I no longer want to pursue a life in liberal arts, I found a new path in a different form of art, the visual arts. I am in love with the abstract paintings of Pablo Picasso and the impressionistic ways of Claude Monet. I dream of being as honest and emotional as Frida Kahlo, whose work in surrealism is just as inspiring.
 
My career goals are to be able to grow in my abilities and discover new things. The glorious thing about college is that it's a chance to discover yourself. Most people are afraid of their future, not knowing how the upcoming years will unfold. I find peace in knowing that I am in charge of my future, and the future includes continuing my education. I look forward to taking new classes and meeting new people in college, something I never experienced living in a small town. I hope to aspire to new heights academically and professionally. Being giving the chance to learn everything I can about art is my ambition.
 
Even now, I work hard to meet my goals. I want to give myself the best possible future. Having the money will help me to pursue my dream, realize my goals and contribute to my field in a wonderful way. ",,Checked

The flight that they were supposed to be on was full which caused them to take the next flight. On this second plane a passenger’s heart stopped beating and his wife was screaming for a doctor or anyone who knew how to perform CPR, or cardiac pulmonary resuscitation. As it happens, my mother had just finished completing a CPR class, which was needed for her EMS program she was taking at the time, and she went over to help the passenger by completing a very successful CPR procedure. In the end my mom saved the man’s life, which he and the airline were very thankful for. This act of kindness my mom performed has inspired me.
     This anecdote is just one of the many reasons I have always wanted to pursue a career in the medicine field. I am confident that I will reach my goal of becoming a Physicians Assistant. First, I plan on attending SUNY Orange to achieve an associate’s degree. While doing so I plan on applying to and volunteering at St. Anthony’s hospital in Warwick, NY. Through keeping my grades up and volunteering in the community I am confident that I will be accepted to a Physicians Assistant program at another college such as SUNY Stony Brook. From there I will be able to use my knowledge, experience, and certification in the medical field to save lives, just like my mom did. My passion of helping others in anyway possible is a quality I believe I have. I plan on helping to save lives though either mission’s trips to underprivileged areas of the world or by joining the navy.  I know that even if I am incapable of reaching my goal of a Physicians Assistant that I, Brooklynn Ramos, will pursue my and passion of helping others, whether it is on a plane, a mission’s trip, or the battlefield serving my country.

","     Sometimes, when the world weighs down, I reflect. I call back a time when I, a now seventeen year old senior at Minisink Valley High School, used to believe that knowledge was an ungraspable thing, a book on a shelf too high for my reach. I may have only been six or seven years old then, but as each new school year drew to a close I can remember feeling an intense worry about the next. Would I keep up? What if I didn't have what it took? Those were mere drops in the ocean where my mind swam. The funny thing was, all the time I had silently lamented about how difficult things would be in coming years, I was learning, and enjoying it. It had never dawned on me then that I possessed the ability to hold my head above the waves and savor each new school year as it passed until I was actually doing it. I never abandoned my practices, I worked hard, I deserved, and as the years passed, I began to set my own personal goals higher and higher still, embracing that awesome feeling of accomplishment that came with each individual achievement. 
     Today is by no means an exception to that trend. I find myself, as of late, refuting the common concept of “Senioritis”, and attempting to set an example for the coming years. It is because of my desire for personal growth and creative thinking that I feel the urge to pursue a post-secondary education filled with challenging and, ultimately, rewarding subject matter. I plan on attending SUNY Orange with the goal of acquiring an associate’s degree in science, which will help prepare me to pursue a higher degree in the field of biological science. I am enticed by the idea of furthering my education to receive even higher degrees than those aforementioned, as said degrees will prove vital in helping me towards my goal of serving my community in the future.
     I shattered my two front teeth as a kid. Ever since, I have been fascinated by the practice of medicine. Countless dentist’s visits, your normal amount of mandatory doctor’s check-ups, a couple root canals, and a trip or two to the cardiologist have taught me to love and respect the powers of medicine. It should come as no huge surprise (but it may be a bit ironic) that I would love an opportunity to pursue a career in one of its many fields. The idea of harnessing one’s knowledge for the benefit of another the same way others have done for me is one that drives me each and every day to reach the mastery level in each of my subjects, if at all possible. Although any career in medicine is an open possibility in my eyes, I have always held the fields of dentistry and pharmacy in high regard. I would love to experience both of them (and others) in any ways possible before my time in college is finished. As I type this, I am in the process of requesting a pharmacy internship for the spring and summer of 2014, and am very excited about the possible opportunity to expose myself to a new area of medical science. I plan to continue seeking out opportunities like this throughout my days in college, in hopes of finding a career field that will allow me to not only better myself, but also the lives of those around me.
     Thank you for your consideration of me for any SUNY Orange Scholarships, as any and all financial assistance would be an enormous help!
     Sincerely,    
     ~Connor Rhodes

","  I have several diversified academic goals as well as professional goals. These goals will help me obtain a successful career while achieving a rewarding life style. First and foremost I am going to graduate high school with an above average GPA. I want to then go to college to continue to enhance my learning experience while maintaining a high average and to be top of my class. I also hope to graduate college with an above average GPA, so that more positions are available to me in the teaching field. My ultimate goal is to become a teacher and inspire students to learn to their best abilities and to help kids on an individual level. I will also learn students' strengths and weaknesses, so they can learn quickly and efficiently as they progress to the higher grades and take what they learned with them. Another goal of mine is to open up my own day care during the summer to help working parents that don't have the ability to provide child care for their children. I would like to be able to provide parents with affordable and superior, care for their children. And I would also like the children to have an unforgettable summer full of learning and fun. Since kindergarten my dream job was to be a teacher for elementary school kids, and this will be my opportunity to make a positive impact on our future. I can achieve these goals by taking advantage of my education. Once I am a certified teacher, I can do for my students what many of my teachers did for me. ","KRINEY (JAKE) FAMILY SCHOLARSHIP

My main goal is to finish college and become a Nurse Practitioner for various reasons. Becoming a Nurse Practitioner means the world to me because it will allow me to help an abundance of society who may or may not be able to get access to healthcare in the United States and the world but, most importantly it will allow me to help my father who has diabetes.

 From an academic standpoint, even finishing two years at this school will allow me to become the first in my immediate family to hold an associate's degree. As I finish my associate’s degree from this school, it will allow me to go to a SUNY four-year school and transfer which will lead me to hold a bachelor's degree in nursing in two more years. After graduation , I will work for one-two years in my field which will allow me to gain experience and as I finish my second year, I will return back to school and go for my Master's Degree in Nursing. I plan on focusing in the general field of Nursing with a minor in pediatrics and diabetes. If my plans go the direction they are heading, I will be able to hold a master's degree before the age of 26.

If all goes well, I will have my dream job in a couple of years and be able to further my goals as a professional. These goals include giving back to the world by going abroad and assisting people who do not have the medical attention they deserve in developing countries located in South America, Asia, and Africa. Another goal, is setting the standard high at my workplace and helping others reach their goals as I have, by being a mentor to them.In addition,I also strive to work my way up the work ladder and hopefully become a chief nurse officer at a top rated hospital such as The New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City or even The Mount Sinai Hospital also in New York City.

These goals may seem far-fetched but they are realistic to me because with hard work and determination, I will become what I have always dreamed of. My academic goals will make me work harder than I have ever had in my life by challenging me to become the best I could be and not letting anyone who stood in my way determine who I will become. My professional goals will let me give back to the community which has surrounded me for the past nine years, which has allowed me to grow and develop into the great person I have become. Both my academic/professional goals will allow my life to face obstacles but not ones that are impossible to overcome.

This coming fall, I will begin my college career.  I will be attending SUNY Orange, majoring in Business Management.  I feel this field suits me, and I am very eager to begin.
	I have chosen Business Management as my major because I feel that this is a career I will excel in.  Business classes that have helped encourage this career path have included Economics, Accounting, and various Math classes.  These classes have inspired me to choose a major similar to these subjects because I enjoyed taking them during high school.  My job has done the same.  Working for a local shepherd with a flock of over 700 sheep on my family's farm has really given me a solid work ethic and motivation to help his small business thrive.  I see his business management first hand as he oversees everything from tending to his flock to the sale of his products, which includes yarn to lamb chops and everything in-between, being sold at market.  I have worked hard over the years in school and in the work place.  Obtaining awards like the President's award for educational achievement and consistently making merit and honor roll have brought me to where I am today.
	My ultimate goal after SUNY Orange is to attend a well-rounded business college that will help me expand my education in the business field.  This will open up so many possibilities for me, and the choices of career paths for me will be endless.  My ultimate goal would be to follow my father and pursue a career in sales.
	This scholarship will help me out tremendously, and every penny will go toward funding my education that any young 18 year old would have trouble affording.  Thank you for considering me for this scholarship.

That was so simple at the time for myself: a firefighter like my father is, or a veterinarian because I love horses—but now everything has changed. The responses do not come as easily anymore, and I am more indecisive than ever about what my future will hold. Now that I am trying to rationalize what my professional goals are, it is quite tedious. I am sure that I want to be successful like anyone else wishes to be, but specifically I am uncertain. Some would view this uncertainty as a weakness, but I, in fact, do not. I view it as a legitimate answer to the question at hand. I have so much to learn about the jobs of engineers, and the engineering workplace that to say I am certain of exactly where I wish to stand within it all would be a lie. Although my profession goals are not up to par with some, they soon will be with the proper education. This education is one that I wish to begin perusing at SUNY Orange, and continue out for many years after as well. My academic goals, on the other hand, are clear as day and I will not stop until I achieve them entirely. 

It is obvious that my professional goals veered off from being a fight fighter or veterinarian, but academically my goals have remained very much the same. I have always had the philosophy that good things come to those that work hard, not to those who wait. My entire life has been a type of game, which I am playing against myself. Every test grade, or report card is like a challenge entirely with myself, to see if I can do even better than the last. This competitive side has come from my long history of competitive sports, but has implanted itself within my academic goals as well. I push myself more than anyone else around me; I expect 100 percent of effort out of anything and everything I do. I never took the time to wish for perfect grades, I would simply work as hard as I could and I soon realized that the grades would follow such dedication. Now that I am taking more advanced and challenging classes like Freshman English 102 at my high school, and Calculus 2 on SUNY Orange campus, I have come to learn the grades may not follow every time. I have recently learned that sometimes things may not go your way, and that is when it is important to learn how to deal with failure, but most importantly be strong enough to over come it. These traits and philosophies are things I will bring with me as I continue my education at SUNY Orange. My academic standards will remain high for myself, as I wish to join the Honors Program. I take great pride in my grades mainly because I have worked so hard for them, and plan to continue down the same path. I realize that it will not be easy jumping into an unfamiliar major with individuals that are well educated, but I can honestly say I am excited and more than ready to take on this challenge. My passion for math, and science continues to burn, and being surrounded by individuals that feel the same will only further ignite this burning flame and allow it to grow.

Because of my palate, I spent many days as a child seeing doctors and nurses. Often scared and not sure what was going on as a child, but now as an adult I appreciate the work they did which allowed me to become the woman I am today. I would not be where I am today without strength and encouragement that my family has shown me. I am returning to school to further my education in the hopes of one day being a nurse and help children with medical conditions. I hope that I can make a different in their lives and the lives of their family as many people did for me. I am nervous about returning to school and I know it may be a long and difficult journey to achieve my ultimate career goals. However, my family has supported me in my endeavors and supports me in returning to school. I want better my life, and act as a positive role model to my nieces and nephews. I believe that you can do anything you put your mind and heart to, and I want to show them they can achieve their dreams with hard work.

The simple idea of building structures and then deconstructing them over and over again, in endless combinations, entertains me for hours. Even nowadays, when I play Legos with my young cousins, I still derive great enjoyment. Little did I know that my adventures with Legos would hold great significance for my future.
	I have decided to pursue the field of engineering. Although, assembling and disassembling Legos may seem like child’s play to most people, it actually requires many advanced skills. Imagination, problem-solving, and diligence are just a few of the skills that I have begun to develop through my Lego creations. These are skills that I hope to improve over time. Not only do these skills apply to engineering, but I’m also finding out that they apply to life in general.
	My educational goals include: getting a bachelors degree in civil engineering and a masters degree in structural engineering. I have been greatly inspired by my oldest brother’s new wife, Rebecca, who holds a masters degree in structural engineering from Cornell University. She is currently employed with a high profile structural engineering firm in Boston, Massachusetts and she has shared many of her work experiences with me. Every time we discuss structural engineering I become highly motivated and excited to begin my studies. I hope to one day hold a position in a structural engineering company so that I, too, can make significant contributions in this field.
	When I converted my Lego spaceship into a New York City skyscraper I had no idea that I was developing my imagination, problem-solving, and diligence. These are things I love to do. I still have a great deal to learn about life and engineering, but there is one thing I know is true: I’m really excited to begin my studies at Orange County Community College.

However, everyone has a different set of goals they want to accomplish once they are done or complete with college. I have both academic and professional goals that I wish to accomplish during this time period. These goals will hopefully help me in guiding myself in the right direction for the rest of my life. 
        When I am in college, I plan to accomplish many goals that pertain to my academics. My first goal is to excel in my classes. I would like to receive high grades in my classes and maintain them throughout each semester. My second academic goal is to pick a major. At this point in my life, I don't know what I want to study. So, I am hoping that I will be able to take a variety of classes in order to discover what I'm really interested in. My third academic goal is to take as many classes as I can that pertain to my major, once I figure out what I want to study. I would also like to participate in any internships or job shadows that are offered in order to get a real feeling of what the career is like. If I can manage to get these all under my belt, I believe these goals will help me in getting into a profession I want to be in. 
        Once my college career is completed, I have goals that I would like to accomplish as well. My first goal is to find a job that will sustain my living. This job might not be my career choice, however it will help me gain good job experiences that will develop my work ethic that I will need in my future career. My second goal is to find my ""dream"" career. I would like to have a job that I have a passion for and will enjoy going to everyday. My third goal is to simply excel in this career. Once I get my ""dream"" career, I want to be greatly successful in it, not for monetary gain, but for personal achievement. I have faith that these goals will help me to become successful in my profession of choice. 
        Both my academic and professional goals will help me discover what I am meant to do when I am older. My goals will allow me to become a successful individual in the future. These goals will also supply me with inspiration and motivation to do the best I can in my life.",,Checked

I want to help other students know its ok to learn the way they do. My academic goal is to earn a degree in education. This is the reason why I want to attend the Jointly Registered Teacher Education Program this upcoming fall. After my 2 years at Suny Orange I will attend Suny New Paltz and finish my degree in education. Then I will start my career as a elementary school teacher.

Diving into the psychological aspect of life, and continuing my passion of mixed media arts, I strive to make a difference in others lives who are unable to express themselves in societies strict mediums.
Professionally, I would like to make a name for myself in the best way I can. Not to be known world wide or by a large amount of people. But to be known and held in the highest form of respect by those who do cross into my path. ""A set goal and steady income"" is forced into adolescents brains at a young age, and understanding the importance of that, I know that where ever I end up I will be doing what I love and making a living just fine.

","I am very clear on my academic and career goals .I want to be a police officer and am excited to be so close to making my career dream a reality .I have worked very hard throughout my academic high school career and will bring that same work ethic and dedication to my college studies.   I plan to attend OCCC for two years and study Criminal Justice. My goal is to study hard and obtain the highest GPA I can. Upon graduation I plan to take the NY State Trooper exam as well as the NYCPD exam. Actually, I will take every law enforcement exam available to me once I complete my degree. Upon hire as a police officer I will explore every avenue and opportunity to me and plan to pursue my college education based on the area I want to grow in. 
I consider myself very lucky knowing what profession I want to build my career in. I chose law enforcement because the instinct I have now towards other people is different than many of my peers. I hate to see slower kids picked on or kids bullied; it just doesn’t feel right inside me. Bullying and bad/criminal behavior gives me a sick feeling. I don’t allow it in my presence and will always help someone who needs it .The Criminal Justice field will give me an opportunity to put a positive impact on my community. I want to make the world a better place. I like to lead by example and to be in a career that will allow me to help people would be a dream come true!
I will work hard academically and will dedicate myself to making the highest grades I can. To obtain a Police Officer position you are offered employment based first on your test score. That being said, studying and doing everything I can academically will give me the best chance at being hired quickly.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to attending OCCC  in the Fall!

I will take part in extracurricular activities, and volunteer around my community. I have had my heart set on Nursing as my career path for about five years. Growing up with three older sisters, I always found myself looking up to them. That is where I started thinking that Nursing may be a good path for me. My oldest sister Janine attended Orange County Community College and transferred to Sullivan County College where she completed her Nursing degree. My family consists of three strong, capable, and hard-working girls. My two other sisters, Brittany, and Kelly, are currently attending State Colleges. Seeing how far they’ve come and how hard they have worked makes me extremely motivated to do the same. Being given the opportunity to pursue my aspirations through such an accredited program offered by Orange County Community College is an honor to me because I know that I have the willpower and potential to never give up and to achieve the best grades that I possibly can. After attending Orange County Community College, I would like to transfer to a State School or University to receive my Bachelor’s degree and soon after that my Masters.

Today, I still have that same passion for animals and going into the veterinary field is something I am interested in and what I intend to do. I am very excited to see where the future takes me and with the opportunities your scholarship can provide, I hope to turn my dreams into a reality.
       All my life I have been surrounded by family pets. I have always enjoyed helping to care for them. The love and happiness that animals return is what makes caring for them worthwhile. They love you unconditionally and you always have a companion. To me, owning a pet is a very rewarding experience. I take great pleasure in volunteering at animal shelters. It is very fulfilling to me. I volunteer at shelters on my own time and the community service club I participate in, Interact, also volunteers at a local animal shelter. At home, my family and I have our own four legged friend who I absolutely adore. Whenever my family has to take our dog to the vet, I am always intrigued and attentive to what the vet says or what he does to help care for my dog. In college, I will first be attending Liberal Arts courses but ultimately, I hope to take the path to becoming a veterinarian or veterinary technician.
        With your scholarship, I believe I can be successful in doing what I love to do the most, caring for animals. I am responsible and take my education very seriously so if I was awarded your scholarship, I know I could fulfill my career goals with ease. It has been said that, ""If you do what you love, you'll never have to work a day in your life."" If I am able to work with animals for the rest of my life, this statement will be validated for me. I thank you for your generosity and for offering these wonderful opportunities that your scholarship can provide me.

My ambition is always to excel in every opportunity presented to me during my academic and professional career. I put much effort into working towards excellence and I highly value what my education has to offer my future.  Every decision I make now will affect my future. That is why it is necessary for me to prepare my academic life after high school not only through grades, but through generous scholarships such as these that are offered.
     My career ambition is to become a network administrator. However, I am aware that computer networking is a flexible major that offers many exciting opportunities in its field. For the last three years, I have been in the Academy of Information Technology, a computer program offered by my high school. Being in the Academy has taught me multiple levels of programming, networking, and web building. Last summer, I was awarded with an internship based on my development with various components of computers at the Town of Wallkill supervisor’s office. Because of this, I have learned that obtaining my virtues in school pays off and has it has made my drive to work hard stronger. I know that I would like to experience working in both a firm and a freelance environment in order to explore the field of networking. I plan on learning all that I can in college as well as through personal research and experience to become a well-rounded worker. 
     I plan to accomplish my career aspirations by attending SUNY Orange's Computer Information Technology Program. During my time at SUNY Orange I plan to be in the Honors Program which involves maintaining a high GPA as well helping out my community through various types of volunteer work. I understand that the computer networking field can be challenging as well as competitive and I will need to think creatively in order to master all my subjects.  This understanding has given me a realistic view of my goals and has proved to me that in order for me to reach them, I must continue to study and work at my highest level. 
I believe that having a positive attitude about life and education is what will contribute most to my goals. My appreciation of schooling and educational opportunities are what drive my strong work ethic and motivation throughout my academic career. This attitude is reflected in my professional life as well and I look forward to maturing it in the future as my profession becomes my target career.
     I look forward to attending college and being introduced to a fresh slate. I know that it will be an experience to change my life and ultimately shape my future. I would be extremely grateful for this scholarship because it can make a grand difference in my college experience.","President’s Scholarship for Outstanding Academic Achievement and President’s Honors Program Scholarship for Outstanding Academic Achievement

","    My professional interests have gravitated toward medicine and health, and like many students, I strongly considered a career as a surgeon or medical specialist, as I believed I could have the greatest impact with very precise expertise.  To better understand my own strengths and interests in the health field, I took advantage of several intensive, hands-on experiences to further define my goals. These experiences refined my course and cemented my interest in a career as a dental hygienist. 
    Last December, I volunteered on a mobile clinic to Esmeraldas, Ecuador to provide free and convenient health care to communities that lacked access to the most basic of needs. Our team of dentists, dental hygienists, doctors, nurses, and volunteers traveled with all our clinic supplies from the US and set up a clinic every morning in a new community around Esmeraldas. As a volunteer, we had shifts at all stations (e.g., general medicine, pharmacy, gynecology, pediatrics, dentistry, and education), but I soon came to realize my passion for dentistry. I was paired with a dentist after shadowing a DH and allowed to help with the procedures (i.e., water and air, using the UV light, mixing filling compounds, tooth charting, fluoride application, and informing the patient their treatment plan). I loved helping the team of dentists and providing the residents with these services! It was gratifying for me to help the dental team remove plaque and watch our progress as we worked and it was rewarding for me to see our patients look in a mirror and smile after leaving the dentist chair. This trip also opened my eyes to the importance of oral health is for overall health as we learned how oral diseases can affect the health of other parts of the body.
    After returning to the US, I began to seek out dental hygienists to shadow and began to realize that this is the right fit for me. Shadowing showed me that hygienists do a lot more than just clean teeth. The offices I shadowed had their hygienists working very closely with the dentists reviewing x-rays, discussing treatment, and educating the patient on possible courses of action. I feel that I have the meticulousness to succeed in these procedures, the academic preparation to excel at SUNY Orange’s rigorous curriculum, as well as a compassionate personality to succeed as an impactful and caring dental hygienist. I am confident that a career as a dental hygienist aligns with my personal and professional goals and I’m excited to start this career path in the fall. Thank you for your time.

","As once stated by Bertrand Russell: ""The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.""  It wasn't until recently that I began to grasp the importance of love and how it is so closely related to knowledge. Through recent experience, I have found that where the two intersect, inspiration can be found. These words - love, knowledge, and ultimately, inspiration - seem strangers unless we take the time to sit back and examine how instead they are actually very closely intertwined. While it is flattering to personify any one of these words, I feel I can't justify doing so without further explaining the roots and exploits of just how I developed a love of knowledge and, therefore, became inspired.

         My older brother and many cousins preceded me to high school so you can imagine my excitement when it was my turn to begin classes at Minisink Valley in the Fall of 2010. While in general it was a good year, let's just say my focus during my freshman year wasn't exactly on academics. I was so caught up in the social aspect of school that my studies finished a distant second. Foolishly, at that point in time, I didn't realize the importance of starting high school off on the right foot. Fortunately, for me, I regained some of my focus heading into my sophomore year.  
	
	As junior year approached and the ""feel good buzz"" of new academic expectations and goals were set out before me, I consciously altered my attitude to achieve what I knew I was capable of. It was at this time that a once-in-a-lifetime friend and tutor walked into my life and instilled in me a love of learning. John Behler was all it took to inspire me to change in every possible way. Fun loving , genuine and always five minutes early, John turned out to be exactly the person I needed. Through obstacles and many accomplishments, my inspiration branched out as a result of the positive reinforcement from everyone around me, especially John.

	Sadly, six months was all I had with him; however, the things I learned will be with me forever. John was killed in a car accident last Feburary. Losing the person who helped me so very much was most definitely a horrible experience. While John never gave me anything I didn't already have, he brought out the best and most in me. Thanks to him I would now say I am a very inspired person in many ways. I have developed a deep love of learning. My hope is to continue to be inspired by the people I surround myself with. Furthermore, I know in my heart I will never lose an ounce of the inspiration or knowledge I hold so close to me thanks to John.

Once I get into the program, complete it, and graduate from SUNY Orange, I would like to find a job as a physical therapist assistant. I have still not decided whether I want to make that my career or go back to school and go towards becoming a physical therapist. I'll deal with that decision when the time comes, but I am very sure that I will have a career in this profession, whether I am just an assistant to a physical therapist or an actual physical therapist and I am looking forward to it. At first, I wasn't so sure whether or not this was the right profession for me. It turns out that one of the requirements for applying to the physical therapist assistant program was to have 16 hours of observation of a physical therapist. Therefore, I spent two 8-hour days in the physical therapy unit at St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital in New Windsor and I observed the physical therapists, talked to some patients and even got to help out with a few patients and I loved it.

I would still get some chances, but there was a lot of competition, until I joined JROTC.  I was one of the top cadets in my class, and I am the top cadet in the battalion now.  I get the opportunity to teach the cadets how to do drill, and I get the chance to explain topics they are confused about.  I love interacting with them and love being in front of the class teaching a lesson.  Being in front of the class teaching creates a natural rush for me and I enjoy every moment of it.  I am really good at public speaking because of JROTC and 4-H together, so I know how to talk to my cadets about anything.  The cadets come to me for help and advice, and it feels so good to help my cadets.  I have always liked helping people.  It creates a great feeling of satisfaction and it builds morality.  As a JROTC mentor, I visited the intermediate school in my district and I would offer to help the teacher that my group was assigned to.  Whatever the class was doing that day was what had to be worked on.  I am a lot better at history and English, but sometimes I had to do math with the kids.  It was a great way for me to learn how to deal with new subjects and teaching the kids how to do a problem in a much easier way.  I have done the same thing for my fellow cadets; I have helped teach math and introduce better ways of solving a problem.  I have even been told that I should be a teacher.
	Upon these comments I started to really think about the idea of becoming a teacher.  I enjoy working with a small group of kids to help them improve, and I am already very good at public speaking.  I have been in 4-H for five years and JROTC for four years, so I have done my fair share of public speaking.  I like to keep things organized and neat, so I would do well at being a teacher.  I would make sure that I had a schedule to follow for my students, and I would be able to maintain a well-organized system of keeping track of assignments and responsibilities.  I work very well with younger kids, but I also connect with my fellow classmates, so I would do fairly well in teaching elementary, intermediate, or high school students. 
	After my two years at SUNY Orange I plan to attend a four year college.  By taking this large step I will improve on my skills, and gain new experiences.  I will learn how to manage time better, and how to bring out the best of my teaching skills.  I prefer to go to Marist in Poughkeepsie, but time will tell the best path for me.  All I know right now is that I am willing to work hard, and I will try my best to be unique and successful in my field.  I am looking forward to the times that I will have, and the capabilities that I will forever treasure as my own.

","Ever since I was little, I dreamed of what I would do with my future. People repeatedly told me ""Do anything it takes to reach your goal"" and ""Set your mind to anything you want and you can achieve it."" Although my plans for my future career changed often from a teacher to a fashion designer, being a therapist even to a lawyer, I never let the fear of failing get in the way. I always had a plan in mind and I was determined to achieve it. Education was always important in my family. I never missed a day of school unless it was absolutely necessary. For me school was never a place I dreaded going to everyday. I was eager to learn new things that would help shape the person I want to become in the future. After months of deciding on what my career path would be, I discovered the many appealing aspects of the medical field and instantly decided that was the way to go. My ultimate goal is to become a Pediatric Surgical Physician's Assistant. In order to reach my goal, I have decided to attend OCCC for two years to finish my prerequisites. As soon as I turn 18 I plan on applying to multiple hospitals and labs as a phlebotomist. Not only will I be able to establish myself in a hospital or laboratory starting at a young age, but I will be able to expose myself to different aspects in the medical field that I might not have known about before hand. After graduating OCCC, I want to transfer to a well established college that offers an excellent PA program. From there I plan on taking all of the necessary steps to achieve my goal.

What made me come to this conclusion was observing my teachers methods of teaching the class and seeing that you can make the learning experience a fun and interesting thing. My teacher would engage in activities with us and speak to us and treat us like the way we wanted to be treated; like young adults. English is definitely my favorite subject and to have an opportunity to make it fun and interesting all while educating students would be the dream job for me. I feel that as a teacher, it is not only your job  to teach the curriculum that is set up for us, but to get on the students level and help them better understand these things so they can be ready for their own future and careers. Being a teacher to me would mean helping kids who are in the same position I was in when I was I high school and help them get through it and put them on the right path to reach their goals and have success. I feel that there's a lot of potential for me in teaching because I'll be doing something that I love all while helping kids figure of their futures and educate them while creating a fun learning environment.

But my answer was alwasy the same, from when I was very young until this very day. My personal career goal is to find a profession involving counseling. I would prefer it to be a job involving children, preferably either a School Counselor or a Social Worker. I would like to build up my income for a couple of years at one of the two jobs. Then eventually I would love to go back to school and get my doctoral degree and become a Psychologist, but I would still love to be able to work with children. They have very imaginative inaginations and I would love to be able to learn just what it is that children are so intrigued by or exactly what it is in there lives that makes them view things as they do. I am very confident in what I can achieve in this specific career field. I am a hopeful optimistic. I always look at things from everyones perspective, at every possible angle, before making any final decision or judgement. I assure you and anyone else that I will make it far in this long journey. I have no doubt in my mind that I will see this out to the end. My heart is set on becoming a Psychologist, it's my dream to try and help those who can't seek or recieve help from anyone or anywhere else. I want children, even adults, to know that there are still good people out there that are willing to help them when they need it most. I want to make a better change in this world.

","   Making a difference is so much more than leaving a mark or creating one. It is about creating yourself and doing what one loves while hoping to inspire people along the way; hoping one can assist them with their dreams, even if one doesn’t share the same ones. Making a difference is also about having the desire and drive to have a positive impact on the world and make it a better place, while giving back to their community. Furthermore, it requires one to put their heart and pride into everything they do and for them to do it with integrity and passion. Therefore, a candidate that suits this figure is someone who has qualities that would persuade others to be the best version of them. In addition to this, I am strongly confident that I can make a difference in the medical field with my qualities and making good use of them to help others, while continuing to be in good academic standing with hunger to excel in life.
   As an avid student who likes to work with people, my career goal is to attend SUNY Orange and become a nurse, where I can continue to pursue my dream and ignite my passion with the facility of speaking Spanish and English fluently . As a future nurse, I know that possessing  valuable qualities that are essential in the medical field such as, being a good problem solver and a great listener, are essential when dealing with difficult situations and listening to the demands of the patients and staff because of the decisions that are made. Moreover, being bilingual offers me the opportunity to help those who have difficulty communicating with others and expressing themselves. Since English was my second language and I learned to speak it in fourth grade, I can relate to the challenge these people face. Therefore, throughout this hardship that greatly impacted my life for the better, I learned the true meaning of comfort zone. I learned what it felt like to be uncomfortable and be on my tippy toes, as if I were taking each step I made with a lot of caution, because I was insecure. But with hard work, I devoted myself to look on the bright side of having the opportunity to learn something new. It was a tough battle, but at the end of the day I not only conquered my fight, but my insecurities. Therefore, comfort zone is the place many of us tend to settle in because we are afraid to try and fail, because it gets hard and playing safe is easier, was the place I neglected to stay in. It took courage to stand on my feet through difficult times that is why this serves as my inspiration to help those who feel intimidated by not speaking English and help them feel confident and improve their self-esteem, because I know how it felt like to be misconceived.  So by putting myself out there I would be promoting a change that would break down a barrier that would lead to something bigger in the future. Furthermore, changes are not made from one day to another; they require persistence, patience and a confident leader. In my opinion, a good leader is defined to be a student engaged in their academics, motivated and eager to achieve their goals. Even more, to go the extra mile, like for example, I took challenging courses that I struggled through, but I seeked help from tutors until I mastered the subject. Likewise, being a hard worker, having good study habits and taking my education seriously, is very rewarding when my grades come in, because i prove to myself that I am capable of what I set my mind to do  and brings me a step closer to making my career goal come true. For this purpose, I am confident that I can commit myself to a prestigious college and give nothing but the best of my ability to honor and represent them in every way or form. Over all, dedicating and devoting myself to taking care of  people and helping their voices be heard,  will trigger a bigger change  in society as we unite, like Ross Perot once said, “ One voice is tiny, and alone it cannot be heard above the din of politics as usual. The people’s voice, when it cries as one, is a great roar.”
	As a final point, being bilingual allows me to be more diversified to make a difference in the lives of people who are in need of communicating with others. Therefore, it is crucial for the patient and the doctor to understand each other thoroughly since they are dealing with one’s health, making it essential for a change like this to come about. Furthermore, translating for patients and doctors would improve their relationship and guide the medical field into having a more diversified staff for the benefit and needs of quality patient care.  Therefore, while promoting a change, I want to serve as an example that people could look up to and admire for doing what is best for society. In addition to this, it would spark a change and inspire society to publicize a change they think would be beneficial, after realizing that, “words are a form of action, capable of influencing change.”(Ingrid Bengis) Over all, impacting my patient’s life for the better and accomplishing my goals, is what I hope to do one day with your help.

My academic goals are to enroll in a major related to the dental profession and get into the best classes being offered at OCCC. My goal is to receive a B or better grade in those courses and graduate at the end of the program.

During this time I am determined to do exceedingly well in all my classes by paying close attention to my professors and completing all tasks that are assigned to me. I am ready to work hard and learn everything I need to know in order to proceed to my next two years at SUNY New Paltz. During my time at OCCC I am going to keep an outstanding average in all of my classes in order to graduate in the top ten percent of my class, as I did in Newburgh Free Academy. I would also like to join any school clubs that interest me in order to interact with my fellow students and learn more about different subjects. During my time in college, I would like to maintain my current job as a cashier at my local supermarket. One major goal I expect to achieve during my time in OCCC is to learn as much as possible to aid me in my many years to come. 
	Following my time in OCCC I will proceed into SUNY New Paltz where I will major in teaching biology. During this time I will continue to maintain a high GPA in order to be placed on the dean’s list. I will also join clubs and partake in extracurricular activities during my time there.
	After completing my studies I plan to start my search for a job opening as a biology teacher at the high school level. I would like to educate students in the field of biology and teach them about the wonders of the world around them. I wish to encourage kids to study biology and pursue job opportunities in the biology field. I believe that educating young adults is a great way to spend my adult life and it is a great way to help me sustain an outstanding family life in terms of working hours and financial needs. 
	I hope to achieve all of my educational and professional goals because I understand how important education is for my life and my future. By learning all I can during my time in college I can achieve all the goals I have set for myself.  I’m looking forward to a bright and happy future.

Some of those goals are for my academic career, and others are for my professional career after graduating college. These goals can seem overwhelming to think about all at once, but I hope to achieve all my goals with the help and guidance of SUNY Orange. 
     The first academic goal that I have upon entering SUNY Orange in the fall is to complete all my necessary and required freshman classes. Being able to successfully complete all the basic classes that I will need to further my education is very important because it will set the foundation for my major. After completing all necessary classes, I plan to start working towards my communications major. I plan on taking communications classes such as public speaking, media campaigns, and public relations writing. Classes like these will help me achieve my overall academic goal of obtaining a bachelor's degree in communications. 
     As for my professional goals after college, I plan to have a career as a public relations specialist. By using the skills and knowledge obtained at SUNY Orange, I plan to get a steady job as a public relations specialist. Not only do I want to strive for a successful, well paying job in my field of study, but I also strive for a job that will make me happy and proud. Success is important in your career, but happiness and pride are equally as important to me. 
    Overall, my academic and professional goals are straight forward and precise. With the help of SUNY Orange, I hope that I can accomplish these goals and be happy with the outcome. In today's world it's difficult to tell what the future will hold, but with hard work and the right foundation, I hope to achieve my goals. ",,Checked

It never failed to intrigue me when my grandmother would talk about when she was younger and her life during the Great Depression.  She would explain the stock market crash of 1929.  As no sufficient amount of money was circulating the lower classes, they would only eat what they could find in the woods, because they were not able to buy food.  She ate one of the best meals in her life during that time, which was just various edible plants my grandfather had found.  But it was not just her and her family that had been affected by these events—everyone’s lives had been affected.  Similar to today, the recession has altered peoples lives as some cannot get a job and others can not afford college to be eligible for a better job.
     In my sophomore year of high school, we read The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck.  My grandmother and her family suffered great financial loss, just like the family in the novel.  I enjoyed reading it as it demonstrated how families struggled to survive in a society where everyone is in the same predicament, just like my grandmother’s family.  I do not like for things to be forgotten, which is one reason why I have an obsession with the past, but it is also because I want to prevent events like the Great Depression from occurring again.  Through my grandmother’s struggle and my accounting teacher, Mrs. Haas, I realized that I could relate my love of history to accounting.  I met Mrs. Haas three years ago when I joined the Academy of Finance, and took her accounting class two years ago.  I loved the class, how she taught it, and that it was real life math.  Presently, I am taking College Accounting with her and I adore it even more.
Through accounting, I want to protect people from the financial dangers of their life that they cannot control, like those that led to the depression.  A company’s managerial department, sometimes, alters their financial statements to look like they are doing better than they really are to that they receive investors.  I do not want to watch people lose their life savings as a company goes bankrupt.  My goal is to study accounting in college to become a Certified Public Accountant, so I avoid seeing this happen.  As a CPA, I will audit companies to make sure they have accurate records and no false statements.  I plan on going to Suny Orange for my associate's degree in Accounting and then transferring to Suny New Paltz for my bachelor’s degree.  My grandmother and her various stories about when she was growing up highly affected my thoughts about my future career.",,Checked

At the present time, my goal is to complete my high school career while consistently improving and maintaining my GPA and class rank of 29 out of 360 plus students. After graduating, I plan to attend SUNY Orange in order to prepare for the future path of my career.  My next goal is to be accepted into the SUNY Orange honors program. This is a goal of mine because I like to be challenged in my academics. When challenged in my academics, I find that I receive much more gratification in learning. Once this is achieved, my goal is to maintain an above average GPA throughout my time in SUNY Orange. In doing so, this will ensure that after my graduation in SUNY Orange, I can be accepted in to my first choice four year university where I can continue my education. Continuing ones education in my eyes is rather important because education is the foundation of one’s success.  In continuing my education, I plan to achieve my ultimate aspiration of a Master of Science Degree in Accounting.  This will lead to the success of my professional goal of becoming a certified public accountant. A certified public account is a career I aspire for because I enjoy analyzing financial details and finding errors in such details. Ultimately, I aspire to work for major accounting firms such as Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young and KPMG. In conclusion, SUNY Orange will be the beginning of what I hope to be my promising future.

I am trying to set an example for my cousins and my younger sister by setting goals and achieving them. When I was in Middle School I set a goal for myself to be on the honor roll.

A future academic goal I have set for myself is that I want to attend SUNY Orange to earn an associates degree in architectural technology and continue on to a 4 year university where I can obtain my bachelors degree in that field. I have already begun to earn credits towards my college degree at Orange-Ulster Boces where I am currently taking Computer Assisted Design. I have worked hard in this program where my average for the last two years is a 95. I am confident I will be able to continue to earn grades like this in college.

Another goal I had set for myself was to become a Junior Firefighter. The training to become a Junior Firefighter was very challenging and demanding. When I became a Junior Firefighter I felt very proud because I set my mind to become a volunteer Firefighter and I did just that. I am currently a Volunteer Firefighter at my local Fire Department where I plan to take courses to become an interior Firefighter when I turn 18. After I obtain my college degree, my professional goals are to work in an architecture firm as well as continuing to advance my knowledge in fire science by staying a volunteer Firefighter with the Highland Mills Fire Department and give back to the community that helped me to get to where I am today.

I greatly value the opportunity to attend college and work towards my academic and professional goals. As I do not have my parents to help me financially, being awarded a scholarship would make a tremendous difference in my life. Thank you for taking the time to read my application.

 ","Ever since I was in Middle School I have known I wanted to be a teacher for an elementary school. I love being with kids and helping them to learn and enjoy their childhood. I want to go to school close to where I live because I want to teach in the same district I went to, so Orange County Community College is an opportunity I want to take advantage of. I want to go to OCCC full time and am already taking classes in High School that are run through OCCC. This is allowing me to better understand the amount of work college is while handling after school activities and a job. I want to work where I went to school because I loved the atmosphere and staff that was there and want to be a part of the family that was created there. My four other siblings all went through this district and still are going through it and I want to be able to go back to where I enjoyed my child hood and give back to families that are going to the same district as I went. I plan on staying at OCCC for the two years I am allowed then am planning on transferring to New Paltz. This school has a great education program, and I want to succeed in my goal to become a great Elementary school teacher. I want to work towards a master’s degree and am willing to work long and hard to achieve my goals of becoming a teacher. I want a master’s degree because than more job opportunities will become available hopefully. My ultimate goal is to get good job at a good school and give back to the community I have lived in all my life. I also have a love for the theater. With this passion, I want to hopefully either start drama clubs within my school or help with their productions. Since I have helped with elementary school shows in the past, I know how the experience of being on stage changes a kid and makes them enthusiastic about being a part of a club that teaches patience while having fun. Being a teacher to me is more than just teaching kids, but to help them understand the importance of their youth and to let them learn in a fun way.",,Checked
